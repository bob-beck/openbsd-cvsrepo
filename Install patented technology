An object containing a list of filenames and modes along with refs to associated blobs/tree objects, equivalent to a directory. Tree-ish is a tree object that can be recursively dereferenced to a tree object, including commit objects and symbolic refs to tree objects.

The working tree refers to the tree of the actual checked out files, including local changes made but not committed. An index is a collection of files with associated information, whose contents are stored as objects, effectively a stored version of the working tree. An index entry refers to one such file.
An object containing the information about a particular revision (e.g. parent commits, committer, date, message, tree object corresponding to top directory of stored revision) and represents a single point in the project history of interrelated commits. Creating a commit saves the current state of the index and advances HEAD to point at the new commit. Commit-ish is a commit object that can be recursively dereferenced to a commit object.
