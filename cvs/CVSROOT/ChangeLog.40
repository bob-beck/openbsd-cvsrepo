sleeping on a chip that is about to be whacked (doing so will change the

Log message:
Fix a one character typo that broke interrupt handling on ironlake.

we disable the interrupt while we are handling it (this is required according to
intel) but instead of writing the version with the master enable bit back to the
Interrupt Enable Register, we wrote it to the Interrupt Indication Register, so
after the first interrupt we only got lucky due to shared interrupts when we
were after anything.

s/IIR/IMR/ on that one call and it works.

the chip which were unstuck by moving the mouse.

	xserver/hw/xfree86/common: xf86AutoConfig.c 

Log message:
Fix autoconfiguration on sparc and sparc64.

The code to add sunffb unconditionally on !solaris for __sparc__
systems is incorrect for openbsd. More specifically, due to interactions
between hardware drivers and wsfb in preinit we can't unconditionally
add wsfb to the list of fallbacks, so we only add wsfb if no other
option was found. Additionally sunffb does not need to be
unconditionally added because the bus probing code will find these
devices already.

So, long story short:  make that code chunk conditional on __sparc__ &&
defined(__linux__) instead.

change from !openbsd to __linux__ requested by kettenis@.

Tested by at least myself and stsp@.

ok matthieu@, kettenis@.

Log message:
Implement a simple, consistent user interface for error handling.
We now have sufficient practical experience to know what we want,
so this is intended to be final:
- provide -Wlevel (warning, error or fatal) to select what you care about
- provide -Wstop to stop after parsing a file with warnings you care about
- provide consistent exit status codes for those warnings you care about
- fully document what warnings, errors and fatal errors mean
- remove all other cruft from the user interface, less is more:
- remove all -f knobs along with the whole -f option
- remove the old -Werror because calling warnings "fatal" is silly
- always finish parsing each file, unless fatal errors prevent that
This commit also includes a couple of related simplifications behind
the scenes regarding error handling.
Feedback and OK  kristaps@;  Joerg Sonnenberger (NetBSD) and
Sascha Wildner (DragonFly BSD) agree with the general direction.

	usr.bin/mandoc : mdoc_term.c 

Log message:
Backout previous.
As Kristaps found out, i was wrong: .Bl -column phrases do not ignore
spacing rules for trailing punctuation in general.  In particular,
- the rightmost column of a column list is unaffected
- columns terminated by the .Ta macro instead of a tab are unaffected
- columns ending in a blank are unaffected
Spacing rules for trailing punctuation are only ignored when the tab
follows the punctuation immediately, without a blank in between,
because then the combination of punctuation and tab is treated by roff
as a word, and the punctuation is not recognized as isolated.
The reason this doesn't work in mandoc is that in the special case
of .Bl -column (not in general!), mandoc treats tabs as word delimiters.
We either need to solve this differently, or call it a bug in roff.

Modified files:
	sys/net        : radix.c 

Log message:
Fix a 16 year old bug in the sorting routine for non-contiguous netmasks.
For masks of identical length rn_lexobetter() did not stop on the
first non-equal byte. This leads rn_addroute() to not detecting
duplicate entries and thus we might create a very long list of masks
to check for each node.
This can have a huge impact on IPsec performance, where non-contiguous
masks are used for the flow lookup.  In a setup with 1300 flows we
saw 400 duplicate masks and only a third of the expected throughput.
Lots of help in narrowing this down from markus@.
Improved comments from claudio@.
OK markus@, claudio@

Log message:
- setting suhosin.session.encrypt per-dir doesn't seem to work
(even with suhosin.perdir set), so just force it in roundcubemail.conf
and remove the program/include/iniset.php patch.

- adjust permissions so the web-based installer can be used as pointed
out by aja, this used to be dangerous but is now controlled by the main
config file and defaults to 'off'.

- bump, adjust MESSAGE

Modified files:
	sys/kern       : kern_workq.c 

Log message:
fix two problems identified by matthew@:

1. though shalt not hold a mutex while sleeping, which kthread_create can
do. instead of holding the wq mutex over the kthread_create and increasing
the number of running threads after kthread_create succeeds, this counts
the thread and drops the mutex before kthread_create. after the call it
takes the mutex again and decrements the number of threads if the call
failed.

2. if a workq is created during autoconf, the actual thread create
is deferred to when the scheduler is running. if the workq is
destroyed before then, the wq memory gets freed and then the deferred
thread creation will be using freed memory. we now have a workq
state variable so we can do the right thing at the different stages
of the workqs lifetime.

Log message:
When extracting the pkg tar file, don't preserve the atime, just set it
to the current time. Works around a rare race condition that can happen
if daily(8) zaps old files from /var/tmp while pkg_add(8) is installing
or updating a package and doesn't yet have moved nor even read some of
the files in /var/tmp/pkginfo.* (typically +DESCR).

Espie wasn't totally happy with this at first, and will eventually work
on something better, so I'm omitting documentations bits for now.

if we're going to set ITSDONE when an xfer is done cos the adapter expects
it, we should clear it before we issue it to the adapter too. retried

remains.

wake up processes that are sleeping while waiting for an io or xs.
they will return NULL to the scsi_{xs,io}_get callers, which should
then check if they device is still alive. all other handlers that
are registered on the queues should be removed by their owners
before the destroy/shutdown funcs are called.

Log message:
Since Aug 2008, the kernel can successfully read the 1 block (512
byte) disklabels even in the midst of a larger sector. E.g. in bytes
512 - 1023 of the first 2048 byte sector on a CD.

On hppa we plopped down such a disklabel on cdXX.iso and installXX.iso.
Once accessible it took precedence over the spoofed label of the CD. Chaos
ensued. Since there is currently no reason for this label on hppa
cd's, eradicate it and its disktab entry. cdXX.iso/installXX.iso can now
be mounted on hppa again.

Also remove a commented out label plopping on Alpha, which references a
non-existant disktab entry.

Problem noted and exact diff creating problem discovered by marco@.

Log message:
Make sure local arrays of chars are word-aligned on strict alignment
architectures, just like what is done for global ones.  This isn't
just an optiization.  There is a long tradition of building packets in
arrays of chars on the stack by using casts to types that require
stricter alignment.  Ignore the language lawyers say it isn't
explicitly allowed by the C standard.  Historically many (all?) C
compilers have handled that just fine, so it is stupid to break this.

Thanks to mikeb@ for finding the GCC bug report against upstream GCC
4.2.1.  This fixes hppa/hppa64 and sparc/sparc64 as discuessed with
miod@ (upstream only fixed sparc/sparc64).  Other strict alignment
architectures will need similar fixes.

Modified files:
	sys/dev        : softraidvar.h softraid.c 

Log message:
During boot probe walk disklist rather than alldevs. This avoids a race
where disks can be on alldevs, however they are not yet initialised and
have not yet called disk_attach() (in particular this means that dk_label
is a null pointer). Also, if we sleep restart the scan from the top of
the disklist in case things have changed whilst we slept.

Log message:
Convert the pcmcia power hook to an activate function.  Then change the
model so that DVACT_SUSPEND methods call sub-drivers with DVACT_SUSPEND
not DVACT_DEACTIVATE, and such.  This creates a whole bunch of fallout,
which needs fixing.
wdc(4), ne(4), and wi(4) have been fully tested and actually work better
than they ever have before (no more wdc timeouts on resume!)
malo(4) has some other nasty bug which has not yet been spotted which
causes crazy panics.
The other drivers are more rare and will be fixed if people show up
with hardware; for now at least they have been adapted to the new model.

Modified files:

	sys/arch/zaurus/dev: zaurus_apm.c 

Log message:
Hurray!  Zaurus apm can now call the activate functions intead of powerhooks.
We call the activate functions at splhigh; unfortunately we cannot suspend a
zaurus at splhigh because on resume the clock is hosed.  We accept this bug
for now... perhaps someone can find it?
(The powerhooks remain in place in the drivers, and will be roto-tilled once
we all the other powerhook-using architectures have switched over)

Log message:
Add buffer_get_cstring() and related functions that verify that the
string extracted from the buffer contains no embedded \0 characters*
This prevents random (possibly malicious) crap from being appended to
strings where it would not be noticed if the string is used with
a string(3) function.

Use the new API in a few sensitive places.

* actually, we allow a single one at the end of the string for now because
we don't know how many deployed implementations get this wrong, but don't
count on this to remain indefinitely.

Log message:
Implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography modes for key exchange (ECDH) and
host/user keys (ECDSA) as specified by RFC5656. ECDH and ECDSA offer
better performance than plain DH and DSA at the same equivalent symmetric
key length, as well as much shorter keys.

Only the mandatory sections of RFC5656 are implemented, specifically the
three REQUIRED curves nistp256, nistp384 and nistp521 and only ECDH and
ECDSA. Point compression (optional in RFC5656 is NOT implemented).

Certificate host and user keys using the new ECDSA key types are supported.

Note that this code has not been tested for interoperability and may be
subject to change.

COMPATIBILTY as sections. these remain defined only for netbsd, since we

Modified files:
	xserver/hw/xfree86/dri: dri.c 

Log message:
Don't even attempt to establish a SIGIO handler for DRI1.

This hasn't been used for a very, very, very long time, (since before
OpenBSD had dri support, for example) and it causes segfaults on dri
drivers when sigio is disabled. Now we don't need to do context swaps on sigio
nor are we trying to do interrupts in userland (thank fuck for that) this
function can die the death that I intended it to die about two years ago, may it
burn.

The kernel support the the sigio ioctl will be removed in a couple of
weeks to give people time to update (right now it accepts it, then
ignores it).

	sys/scsi       : cd.c sd.c sdvar.h st.c 
	sys/sys        : buf.h 

Log message:
make struct bufq a member of the softc for devices that use it,
rather than it being a pointer to something that needs to be allocated
at attach. since all these devices need a bufq to operate, it makes
sense to have it allocated as part of the softc and get bufq_init
to just initialise all its fields. it also gets rid of the possibility
that you wont be able to allocate the bufq struct during attach,
which is something you dont want to happen.

secondly, it consistently implements a split between wrapper functions
and the per discipline implementation of the bufq handlers. it
consistently does the locking in the wrappers rather than doing
half in the wrappers and the other half in the implementations.

it also consistently handles the outstanding bufq bq pointer in the
wrappers.

this hides most of the implementation inside kern_bufq.c. the only
stuff left in buf.h is for the bits each implementation needs to
put inside struct buf.

were telling gnutls to not do TLS1.0 or TLS1.1, but that means with
newer versions of gnutls that support TLS1.2 it would try to negotiate
that instead and generally fail. Fix that by disabling TLS1.2 too
(which works fine even with gnutls versions that don't support TLS1.2
yet)."

Log message:
After all escape sequence processing, check for being beyond the last

This fixes the case where an escape sequence (originally noticed with
DECSTBM) moves the cursor and doesn't reset the flag - if it was set,
there would be a spurious line feed on the next input.

Log message:
bus_dmamap_sync() freshly initialized Rx descriptors before flipping the bit
that hands them over to the hardware.  This prevents the hardware from seeing
stale contents if the compiler decides to re-order stores or if the hardware
does store-reordering.

There are sme doubts whether the i386/amd64 bus_dmamap_sync() implementation
will be able to convince future compilers that do even more insanely stupid
optimizations from re-ordering stores.  That will be addressed in a seperate
patch.

Log message:
When knocking out a MULTI_PACKAGE on some arch, keep listing it in
MULTI_PACKAGES, and add an (ONLY|NOT)_FOR_ARCHS-subpkg=somearch, rather
than changing contents of the MULTI_PACKAGES variable.

Fixes dpb builds on !amd64/i386, because the bsddb package was
knocked out on other arch.

amd64 did' landry@

Modified files:
	share/man/man7 : operator.7 

Log message:
Both old and new groff behave in the following way: Literal tabs are
considered normal word characters even when delimiting column phrases
in .Bl -column.  Thus, in any column but the last, if the column is
terminated by a literal tab, and the last character is a solitary dot,
that dot is NOT considered punctuation, and consequently offset from
the preceding text by a blank space.  This space does not occur when the
Ta macro is used inmstead of a literal tab, or when a blank character is
inserted between the dot and the tab.

Confused now?  So were we.
We decided to consider that a bug in groff, not a feature,
and to not emulate it in mandoc(1).
Thus, let operator(7) no longer depend on that groff bug.

Log message:
Some stupid hardware marks PCI BARs as prefetchable that aren't side-effect
free.  Mapping those with BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFETCHABLE can have disastrous
effects, like the NMIs observed by jsg@ with certain Intel 10Gb Ethernet
devices.  So stop trusting the devices and instead require drivers to
explicitly pass the BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFECTHABLE flag to pci_mapreg_map().
The pci_mapreg_info() call will continue to return BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFECTHABLE
flags for prefetchable BARs as an easy way to figure out whether a BAR is
prefetchable.  Since the vga_pci.c code uses this interface, all consumers
of VGA BARs will still use the BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFETCHABLE flag when
appropriate.

	sys/dev/pci    : agp_i810.c 
	sys/dev/pci/drm: i915_drv.c i915_drv.h 

Log message:
Rev 1.67 of intagp (agp_i810.c) was added to deal with the problem
where stuff was bound for a software fallback while we were vt switched,
so we couldn't assume that the aperture was clear.

Turns out that the 855 at least does not like this (the !stolen bits of
the bar at least are write-only), and this caused a gpu lockup on any
suspend that used that activate handler.

So this diff fixes it in a more complete way:

Firstly revert 1.67 of agp_i810.c, secondly add a DVACT_QUIESCE handler
to inteldrm, and in it we do three things:

1) set a flag that causes any ioctl or pagefault to sleep until the flag
is cleared so that we don't end up with something doing the following
(for example:)
- bind object
- do another blocking operation in the same ioctl/fault
< suspend happens here, followed by resume>
- wake up assuming that the object is still bound and continue along our
merry way

2) Wait for all current entrypoints to finish (so that 1) is actually
effective we need to first quiesce our callers before we continue).

3) unbind everything that is in the gtt

On resume we clear the quiet flag, and everything can continue as
expected.

Behaves as expected for me on: 855 (x40 in acpi mode), gm965 (x61s) and
arrandale (x201) over multiple suspend cycles. Also tested by several on
tech.

Make sure bus_dmamap_sync() always involves a function call, to prevent the
compiler from doing stupid things like reordering stores around it.  There is
some debate whether this will be enough for newer versions of GCC and LLVM.
If this is indeed deemed necessary, this will be addressed in a future diff.

Log message:
End the VOP experiment. Instead of the ridicolusly complicated operation
vector setup that has questionable features (that have, as far as I can
tell never been used in practice, atleast not in OpenBSD), remove all
the gunk and favor a simple struct full of function pointers that get
set directly by each of the filesystems.

Removes gobs of ugly code and makes things simpler by a magnitude.

The only downside of this is that we loose the vnoperate feature so
the spec/fifo operations of the filesystems need to be kept in sync
with specfs and fifofs, this is no big deal as the API it self is pretty
static.

Many thanks to armani@ who pulled an earlier version of this diff to
current after c2k10 and Gabriel Kihlman on tech@ for testing.

Liked by many. "come on, find your balls" deraadt@.

Log message:
- slightly improve the situation on sparc64:
* extend the DO_ALIGNED_COPY usage from girnode.c into ginfo.c
(freebsd seems to do the same)
* skips tests/scanner/ as opensolaris and several other distributions do,
this prevents g-ir-repository SIGBUSing there and allows the build to succeed.

it's not really a great improvement (apart from ginfo.c patch), but at least
it allows things to move forward, and gobject-introspection isn't enabled yet
in other ports.

Log message:
Introduce a disk_lookup() function which calls device_lookup(), before
verifying that the resulting device is present on the disklist. This
avoids a race whereby the disk driver can be accessed as soon as the
softc has been allocated, but before the disk has completed
initialisation and has called disk_attach() (up until this point
dk_label is still a null pointer).

Cut cd(4), sd(4) and wd(4) across to disk_lookup(). All callers of
disk_attach() need to be tested and cut over in due course.

Log message:
The resume powerhooks were always in the wrong place. Then when replaced
by the device-tree activate walk it even worse since we were doing so much
more work.  apm_suspend() could return into the event handler and thus
tsleep() -- all this while we are supposedly trying to maintain splhigh
because our DVACT_SUSPEND mechanism has temporarily totally wrecked the
machine.
Move the hardware restoration code (DVACT_RESUME + other goo) to the same
function, and recognize that apm_resume() is just a boring event handler
which punts the event to userland.

Log message:
ECDH/ECDSA compliance fix: these methods vary the hash function they use
(SHA256/384/512) depending on the length of the curve in use. The previous
code incorrectly used SHA256 in all cases.

This fix will cause authentication failure when using 384 or 521-bit curve
keys if one peer hasn't been upgraded and the other has. (256-bit curve
keys work ok). In particular you may need to specify HostkeyAlgorithms
when connecting to a server that has not been upgraded from an upgraded
client.

    import p5-Hash-AutoHash 1.12
    
    This is yet another module that lets you access or change the elements
    of a hash using methods with the same name as the element's key. It
    follows in the footsteps of Hash::AsObject, Hash::Inflator,
    Data::OpenStruct::Deep, Object::AutoAccessor, and probably others. The
    main difference between this module and its forebears is that it
    supports tied hashes, in addition to regular hashes. This allows a
    modular division of labor: this class is generic and treats all hashes
    the same; any special semantics come from the tied hash.

Log message:
if a busy sas device is unplugged, the pending io on that device will
never complete.

when we get a detach event from the firmware, we currently deactivate the
device and then request the scsi midlayer attempt to detach the device.
this diff now deactivates the device and then resets the target, forcing
the ioc to complete the pending operations. once the reset has completed
we then request a detach of the kernel device.

this lets me hotplug busy sas disks without leaking scsi_xfers or bufs or
anything.

Log message:
Using a normaly unavailable 0.0.0.1 gateway on routes on sppp(4) based
devices is a bad idea. The problem is that the default route per se works
but PMTU is unable to clone host routes because the gateway is unreachable.
Fix sppp(4) so that it walks the routing table and fixes the gateways.
This makes PMTU work again. Diff tested by weerd@ and markus@ (older version)
for a long time.

Log message:
Parse and ignore the \k, \o, \w, and \z roff escapes, and recursively
ignore embedded escapes and mathematical roff subexpressions.
In roff copy mode, resolve "\\" to '\'.
Allow ".xx\}" where xx is a macro to close roff conditional scope.
Mandoc now handles the special character definitions in the pod2man(1)
preamble, so remove the explicit redefinitions in chars.c/chars.in.
From kristaps@.

I have checked that this causes no relevant change to the Perl manuals.
The only change introduced is that some non-ASCII characters rendered
incorrectly before are now rendered incorrectly in a different way.
For example, e accent aigu was "e", now is "e'"
and c cedille was "c", now is "c,".

Log message:
the openings member of scsi_link is the maximum number of commands that a
scsi device can have in flight. instead of counting users of openings on
the bus by taking away from the openings value, count the number of
pending commands on the bus in a new pending variable.

this lets us know how many outstanding commands there are. we can then use
that to make sure that all commands a device has generated get completed
before detaching the device. this helps avoid resource leaks and use after
frees.

tested by me on pci ehci/umass, fc mpi, and sas mpi.
tested by jakemsr on cardbus ohci umass.
it found issues in sas mpi which were fixed as a result of this diff.

	                   patch-src_Pugs_Types_hs 

Log message:
Pugs.Types defined an Eq instance for Control.Concurrent.STM.TMVar (from
the stm package), which is no longer possible, because TMVar is deriving
Eq now. So move the (somewhat crude)  comparision based on addressOf (which
comes from the hs-pugs-compat package) into Pugs.AST.Types, providing an
explicit Eq instance for VThread.

IMHO, instance declarations for standard type classes on types imported
from other Haskell packages are evil.

Breakage noticed by naddy@.

While here, update WANTLIB and bump.

Log message:
It's 2010.  OpenSSH is THE version of ssh that most people use, and
probably the ONLY version many people have used, it isn't the "Free
Alternative" anymore.  Start of a rework of this FAQ to bring it
up-to-date and refocus it as the authoritative introduction to "the"
version of ssh that most people will use.
Just 1.1 for now.  Simpler explaination for those who have never
used alternatives to OpenSSH, OpenBSD users: just run recent versions
of OpenBSD, non-OpenBSD users start with your OS vendor.
After waiting for formal oks, agreement to a
"commit now and djm@ and dtucker@ will beat the snot out of me if I
screw up" from djm@.

    import fritzing 0.4.2
    
    Fritzing is essentially Electronic Design Automation software suited to the
    needs of designers and artists. It uses the metaphor of the breadboard,
    so that it is easy to transfer a hardware sketch to the software by using a
    drag-and-drop-based GUI to copy your sketch. From there it is possible
    to create PCB layouts for turning your prototype into a robust PCB,
    either on your own, or with the help of a manufacturer.

Log message:
    import ports/graphics/darktable, thanks ajacoutot@ for review+fixes.
    
    darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers:
    it manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
    them through a zoomable lighttable. It also enables you to develop
    raw images and enhance them. It tries to fill the gap between the
    many excellent existing free raw converters and image management
    tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
    
    All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached
    image buffers for display. The full image is only converted during
    export. Raw files, high-dynamic range and standard image formats
    such as jpeg are all supported. The core operates completely on
    floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for
    photography but also for scientifically acquired images or output
    of renderers (high dynamic range).

	                         patch-data_ui_rhythmbox-ui_xml 
	                         patch-plugins_Makefile_in 

Log message:
Several cleanups:
- add missing run_depends on py-gnome-desktop (needed for the magnatune
plugin)
- remove the audiocd plugin which requires cdda support in gvfs and that
is only possible with either HAL or gudev
- remove the "Scan Removable Media" from the interface, as for the same
reason we disable the audiocd plugin
- enable support for iPod (untested I own no such device)

when a lib has multiple different library names, populate the .libs dir with
symlinks to all of them.

this fixes kde/multimedia, which builds a libmpeg-0.3.0.so (using -release),
also known as libmpeg.so, and then links something with -lmpeg ...
(before this commit, we only had a symlink to the former)
it should really just use libmpeg.la instead, but let's have libtool handle
such attempts anyway.
might fix other stuff i'm not yet aware of, too.

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/snmpd : mps.c snmpd.h snmpe.c 

Log message:
Return error on GET requests without an instance identifier, both for
tables and scalar values.

Fixes system/6468 by not calling table get functions with an unexpectedly
short OID.

Also fixes system/6071. Scalar variables without an instance specified now
returns a noSuchInstance error. GetNext requests correctly returns the .0
instance.

This means you can no longer rely on
$ snmpget -v2c -c public localhost SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr
returning the .0 instance. You need to specify it explicitly:
$ snmpget -v2c -c public localhost SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0

Also return proper SNMPv2 errors per varbind instead of a noSuchName error
status, unless SNMPv1 was specified in the request.

An earlier version of this diff tested by Remi Laurent, thanks.

Log message:
umass is set up to only handle one command on the bus at any point
in time, which is a problem if your umass device has multiple luns
on it. if multiple commands are issued at the same time then they
step on some shared state, which in turn causes some interesting
panics.

this diff introduces an iopool in umass so only one command can be
"allocated" and scheduled at a time.

Log message:
pflog overhaul
pflog was logging the "wrong" as in not yet rewritten (nat/rdr) addresses.
to address this without making an extra copy of the mbuf chain:
-introduce bpf_mtap_pflog, which is a 1:1 copy of bpf_mtap_hdr, except that
it supplies bpf_catchpacket with pflog_bpfcopy as copy function instead of
plain bcopy
-said new shiny pflog_bpfcopy knows what a pflog packet looks like, copies
everything into bpf's buffer, contructs a fake mbuf (which is allocated once
at attach time and reused over and over) which points to the bpf buffer
as data storage
-call pf_setup_pdesc on said fake mbuf
-then call pf_translate to rewrite the addresses as needed right in the
bpf buffer
this changes the pflog header as we have to pass the new addresses/ports
around. relies on canacar's awesome work in libpcap to work olrite with the
new, longer pflog header as well as with the old, shorter one.
almost completely written at c2k10 in canada, finished here at j2k10 in
japan. ok ryan dlg

Log message:
after ruleset eval is done, we must apply actions from the last matching
pass or block rule, not the last matching rule. triggered by pr6401.
this means that, for example, a rdr-to on a pass rule can override an
rdr-to on a match rule that comes later in the ruleset. but that's the
semantics: for block and pass rules, the last matching one wins, aka
actions are applied after we're done with ruleset eval, and match rules'
actions are applied on the fly. discussion with dlg and claudio, ok dlg ryan

Log message:
The size of sc_status[] (the buffer for USB hub's interrupt pipe) will be
determined by bNbrPorts in hub descriptor.

USB hub sends status packet to host, it contains status bits for each port
and hub itself. So, the packet size is ceil((port + 1) / 8) bytes.

If host requests smaller than that size, the hub behavior is undefined.
Some hub (Intel's RMH for example) sends whole status every time,
it makes babble of USB. This is the reason that uhub_intr() of old code
was suffered from USBD_IOERROR,

do here ourselves. so we can continue with disabling the hardware and
cleaning up then return success.

Log message:
Zero newly allocated space, to avoid (in some cases) passing an
unclean buffer to Perl_is_utf8_string which proceeds to strlen() it,
causing an illegal access with malloc_flags J as it runs past the
end of the 0xd0d0d0.

Note there are various other problems with YAML::Syck and upstream
recommend not using it - see the README file.

Log message:
OCF support for the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for AES as
described in FIPS SP 800-38D.

This implementation supports 16 byte authentication tag only,
splitting transformation into two parts: encryption and
authentication.  Encryption is handled by the existing
AES-CTR implementation, while authentication requires new
AES_GMAC hash function.

Additional routine is added to the software crypto driver
to deal with peculiarities of a combined authentication-
encryption transformation.

With suggestions from reyk, naddy and toby.

Changes by:	mikeb@cvs.openbsd.org	2010/09/22 07:40:05

Modified files:
	sys/netinet    : ip_esp.c 

Log message:
Support for AES-GCM-16 and ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC in ESP as per
RFC 4106 and 4543.

Authentication hash key is set to be the same as an encryption key.

The length that is specified for the authentication hash descriptor
denotes the the length of Additional Authentication Data (AAD).
The encryption transformation descriptor length denotes the length
of the payload (to be encrypted and authenticated).

ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC treats all input as AAD, thus the encryption
length is set to zero.

This also fixes padding for stream ciphers, so that payload will
be 4-byte aligned.

	sbin/ipsecctl  : ike.c ipsec.conf.5 ipsecctl.h parse.y pfkdump.c 
	                 pfkey.c 

Log message:
Support AES-GCM-16 (as aes-gcm) and ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC
(as aes-gmac) encryption transformations in the ipsec.conf(5).

Available "enc" arguments denoting use of

1) AES-GCM-16:

aes-128-gcm for 160 bit key (128+nonce)
aes-192-gcm for 224 bit key (192+nonce)
aes-256-gcm for 288 bit key (256+nonce)

2) ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC:

aes-128-gmac for 160 bit key (128+nonce)
aes-192-gmac for 224 bit key (192+nonce)
aes-256-gmac for 288 bit key (256+nonce)

Please note that aes-gmac family performs no encryption and provides
no confidentiality and is intended for cases in which confidentiality
is not desired (it can be thought of as AH with NAT-T support).

Also, although this implementation supports manual keying, it's
use is strictly discouraged as AES-GCM security depends on frequent
re-keying.  So it can be thought of as a debug facility only.

Example configuration:

ike esp from 172.23.61.36 to 172.23.61.156 \
quick enc aes-256-gcm \
psk humppa

Thoroughly tested by me and naddy.  Works fine with Linux.

Requires updated pfkeyv2.h include file.

Log message:
add a 'dying' flag to struct usbd_bus.  use this to signify the bus
is dying, instead of setting a flag in struct usb_softc.  as
usbd_device_handle has a pointer to the usbd_bus it's attached to,
usb devices, and functions they run or functions run on their behalf,
can now easily check if their bus is dying.  use this to stop
usbd_do_request* from running and the usb task thread from adding
new tasks when a device's bus is dying.

Modified files:

Log message:
add two members to struct usb_task
* usbd_device_handle dev - the device responsible for the task.  use
this to not run the task if the device's hub is dying.
* int running - a flag to be set when the task is running.

add usb_rem_wait_task(), a wrapper for usb_rem_task() that waits for
the task to complete if the task is already running.

s/usb_rem_task/usb_rem_wait_task/ in usb_detach().  probably most
drivers using usb_tasks should do this as well.  although device
attach/detach is serialized in normal cases, in the special case
where the usb bus is hotpluggable (like cardbus/pcmcia), devices
are not detached in the task thread.

Log message:
returning here can cause the usb task thread to go to sleep forever,
becaue it skips a wakeup() later on.  this is the only error condition
that returns before the wakeup.  not sure why this particular case is
handled differently, and not certain what the error code should be, but
this is better than breaking all of usb because of a problem on one port.

Log message:
tweak the mclgeti algorithm to behave better under load.

instead of letting hardware rings grow on every interrupt, restrict
it so it can only grow once per softclock tick. we can only punish
the rings on softclock ticks, so it make sense to only grow on
softclock tick boundaries too.

the rings are now punished after >1 lost softclock tick rather than
>2. mclgeti is now more aggressive at detecting livelock.

the rings get punished by an 8th, rather than by half.

we now allow the rings to be punished again even if the system is
already considered in livelock.

without this diff a livelocked system will have its rx ring sizes
scale up and down very rapidly, while holding the rings low for too
long. this affected throughput significantly.

discussed and tested heavily at j2k10. there are still some games
with softnet we can play, but this is a good first step.

Modified files:
	sys/miscfs/procfs: procfs_vfsops.c 

Log message:
In procfs_root(), while the vn_lock on a newly-allocated vnode can not
fail it is still good practise to either check the return value or to
provide a flag that won't (to avoid copy pasted code that gets it
wrong).

So change LK_EXCLUSIVE to LK_EXCLUSIVE | LK_RETRY, removing the one
caller of vn_lock in the tree that doesn't either pass LK_RETRY or check
the return value.

Log message:
The only sensible argument for VOP_* calls that take a struct proc pointer is
curproc. A bunch of callers were passing in 0 (not even NULL, 0) as this
pointer, which was fine until the called vnode function tried to do
something with it. Typically, this code was then copy/pasted to various
parts of the tree.

Accept the facts of life and switch all of these over to passing curproc
for now until the argument can be removed.

Discovered by stsp trying to create a softraid on top of a vnd, which
crashed with a NULL deref in vndioctl.

softraid bits tested by mikeb and jsing. raidframe bits tested by pea,
matthieu and naddy. The rest tested by at least thib, jsing and myself.

Log message:
Bump all ruby ports not already handled.

In the upgrade from ruby 1.8.6 to 1.8.7, the PLISTs changed
due to differences in how RDoc processes files.

This also has a number of changes to the regress tests to
work with the changes to devel/ruby-rake.  It moves most of
the regress tests to use MODRUBY_REGRESS.

use pd->rdomain for the PF_MISMATCHAW checks in pf_test_fragment instead of

roughly almost a bit equivalent to what pf_test_rule does. changing the
rdomain for not reassembled fragments is not going to work ever, so the
full dance pf_test_rule does doesn't make sense here.
speaking of sense, I don't see anything remotely resembling sense in
pf filtering on fragments without reassembling them first.

Log message:
TCP send and recv buffer scaling.
Send buffer is scaled by not accounting unacknowledged on the wire
data against the buffer limit. Receive buffer scaling is done similar
to FreeBSD -- measure the delay * bandwith product and base the
buffer on that. The problem is that our RTT measurment is coarse
so it overshoots on low delay links. This does not matter that much
since the recvbuffer is almost always empty.
Add a back pressure mechanism to control the amount of memory
assigned to socketbuffers that kicks in when 80% of the cluster
pool is used.
Increases the download speed from 300kB/s to 4.4MB/s on ftp.eu.openbsd.org.

Based on work by markus@ and djm@.

Add stricter asserts to DIAGNOSTIC kernels to help catch mutex and
rwlock misuse.  In particular, this commit makes the following
changes:

1. i386 and amd64 now count the number of active mutexes so that
assertwaitok(9) can detect attempts to sleep while holding a mutex.

2. i386 and amd64 check that we actually hold mutexes when passed to
mtx_leave().

3. Calls to rw_exit*() now call rw_assert_{rd,wr}lock() as
appropriate.

Modified files:
	lib/libarch/mips64: Makefile 
	lib/libc/arch/mips64/gen: Makefile.inc 
Added files:
	lib/libarch/mips64: get_fpc_csr.3 
	lib/libc/arch/mips64/gen: fpc_csr.c 

Log message:
Provide IRIX-compatible get_fpc_csr() and set_fpc_csr() for mips, although
we don't provide the silly union to decompose the value. This will allow
userland to flip the ``flush denormalized to zero'' setting, which apparently
is being relied upon by tcl.

Asked by jasper@ a long time ago. Riding upon the upcoming libc major crank.

Modified files:
	sys/netinet6   : nd6_rtr.c 

Log message:
When processing IPv6 RA messages we may end up adding a new IPv6 address
from interrupt context. This results in problems if the process of adding
a new address makes use of pools that use PR_WAITOK (or anything else that
may sleep). To avoid this problem, create a workq task so that the new
IPv6 address is added from within process context.

Log message:
Add support pipex for L2TP call and L2TP on IPv6.
- pipex requires unique session-id in protocol, so session-id
generation algorithm has been changed.
- change to fit the new PIPEX ioctl.

Log message:
ppb(4) should respect pci_dopm, like pci(4) does, and not try to poweroff
the bridge if pci_dopm=0.

Fixes Gateway LT3103u and Lenovo Thinkpad 100e netbooks, allowing them to
suspend again (if pci_dopm is set to 0 in acpi.c). Tested by myself and
deraadt on a variety of hardware.

Two new options:

- server option "exit-unattached" makes the server exit when no clients

- session option "destroy-unattached" destroys a session once no clients

These are useful for preventing tmux remaining in the background where
it is undesirable and when using tmux as a login shell to keep a limit
on new sessions.

Log message:
Merge the last bits of 1.10.6 (released today), most were already in:
* ignore double-.Pp
* ignore .Pp before .Bd and .Bl (unless -compact in specified)
* avoid double blank line upon .Pp, .br and friends in literal context
* cast enums to int when passing them to exit(3) to please lint(1)
While merging, fix a regression introduced by kristaps@:
Outside literal mode, double blank lines must both be printed.
To achieve this again after kristaps@ improvements in 1.10.6,
treat such blank lines as .sp (instead of .Pp as in 1.10.5)
and drop .Pp before .sp just like dropping .Pp before .Pp.

Correct the handling of GS.base when iretq faults: the fault happens
with CPL == 0 but the user's GS.base, so the normal INTRENTRY handling
won't work.  Contrawise, the asm that trap() redirects us to when that
happens (resume_iret) sees a trapframe showing CPL==3 but it's run with
the kernel's GS.base, so INTRENTRY won't work there either.

Log message:
Remove MASTER_SITES from most ruby gem ports, specify it in ruby.port.mk

All ruby .gem files are now hosted on rubygems.org in the same
directory.  If the ruby gem CONFIGURE_STYLE is used, make the
default MASTER_SITES that directory.

There are still a few uses of MASTER_SITE_RUBYFORGE in the tree, for
some ports that aren't gems, or where the .gem file isn't hosted on
rubygems.org, or where the hashes don't match.  Most of these will be
dealt with in the near future.

This was only used in two ports, and will never be used in more ports
as GitHub no longer builds new gems.  Both of the ports are also

MASTER_SITE_RUBYGEMS from ruby.port.mk. ruby-findmyiphone has a small

Log message:
In the implementation of the SIOCS80211DELNODE ioctl, call
ieee80211_node_leave() instead of ieee80211_release_node() which screws
up reference counting and leads to use after free problems elsewhere in the
code.  Since ieee80211_node_leave() is only available if hostap support is
compiled in, don't privide the SIOCS80211DELNODE ioctl if we're compiling
without hostap support (e.g. on ramdisks).

Log message:
*** HEADS UP!

Major update to glib2-2.26.0.
This starts a flood commit of several big updates (gtk+2 and GNOME 2.32).

Please note that there will be some WANTLIB/DEPENDS breakage probably,
this went into several bulks but it's impossible to catch everything.
Any gtk+2/glib2 related build failures, please talk to me or jasper@

The ports tree is expected to be in a unconsistent state for a couple of
days to give us time to fix everything we didn't spot or any runtime
issue with the latest GNOME.
We do this now so that we have packages with all the latest major bumped
libraries at p2k10.

Thanks to landry@ and his zomg!cluster for the bulks and reports.

Some stupid hardware marks PCI BARs as prefetchable that aren't side-effect
free.  Mapping those with BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFETCHABLE can have disastrous
effects, like the NMIs observed by jsg@ with certain Intel 10Gb Ethernet
devices.  So stop trusting the devices and instead require drivers to
explicitly pass the BUS_SPACE_MAP_PREFECTHABLE flag to pci_mapreg_map().

bus_dmamap_sync() freshly initialized Rx descriptors before flipping the bit
that hands them over to the hardware.  This prevents the hardware from seeing
stale contents if the compiler decides to re-order stores or if the hardware
does store-reordering.

There are sme doubts whether the i386/amd64 bus_dmamap_sync() implementation
will be able to convince future compilers that do even more insanely stupid
optimizations from re-ordering stores.  That will be addressed in a seperate
patch.

Log message:
Retire Skipjack

There's not much use for the declassified cipher from the 80's
with a questionable license these days.  According to the FIPS
drafts, Skipjack reaches its EOL in December 2010.

The libc portion will be removed after the ports hackathon.

djm and thib agree, no objections from deraadt
Thanks to jsg for digging up FIPS drafts.

perl command that accepts filename arguments and modifies the common
/usr/bin/env ruby shebang to ${RUBY}.  MODRUBY_ADJ_FILES is a short
cut that allows you to set filename patterns and have
MODRUBY_RUBY_ADJ called on all files in ${WRKSRC} that match that
pattern.  It adds a pre-configure action to do so, if a pre-configure
action is not already defined.  If a pre-configure action is already
defined, you can call the replacement command with
${MODRUBY_ADJ_REPLACE}.

Log message:
backout the "new" queue code commited 4 months ago. it has many good ideas,
is way more optimized than what we had earlier and there's definitely stuff
we want to keep, however it is early optimization that doesn't account for
many features and makes them hard (if not impossible) to write without
ugly workarounds that ruin the purpose of the optimizations.

the backout goes to 30 May's right before the commit and catches up on all
the non-queue related commits that happened since then.

i'll work on reintroducing the ideas from this queue when the basic
features we expect from a MTA are implemented.

suggested on tech@ about a week ago, no objections, several "please make
smtpd move forward" mails from hackers and tech readers.

Log message:
    import separate port of gfortran 4.2.1, in sync with the base compiler.
    meant to be used on archs that have gcc4 in base, this doesn't require a
    full gcc build from ports, and provides libgfortran as a subpackage.
    
    idea from espie some months ago.

Log message:
Implement an rtsocket filter for rtableids. A process will initially
only get messages that are for the rtable the process is bound to.
Depending on the rtm_type the rdomain or rtable id are used for
comparison.  It is possible to change the filter with a setsockopt(s,
AF_ROUTE, ROUTE_TABLEFILTER,...) and if set to RTABLE_ANY the filter
is deactivated.  Additionally set the tableid in struct if_msghdr
to the rdomain id and use the process rtableid in the sysctl if no
table was specified.

Log message:
Force openings to 1 for devices that can't do tagged i/o, i.e. more
than 1 i/o active at once.  This reduces the chances that concurrent
i/o's for such devices will confuse the device or the adapter code.
It also eliminates a reason for adapter code to maintain its own
queues.

Tweak all drivers that fake INQUIRY results to set the SID_CmdQue
flag, thus continuing to claim to be able to do tagged i/o.

Positive feedback from matthew@ and marco@ for an earlier version.

Log message:
    import ports/sysutils/py-lockfile, ok jasper@
    
    The lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API for
    locking files.  Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf
    and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is
    identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms.
    The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) and
    mkdir (on Windows) system calls.  An implementation based on SQLite is also
    provided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides than as
    production-quality code.

Modified files:
	lang/ruby      : ruby.port.mk 

Log message:
Don't build C extensions inside gems during the fake stage, instead
build them during the build stage and install them during fake.

devel/ruby-gems doesn't have separate build and install commands, as
most gems are pure ruby code and don't need a separate build stage.
When ruby-gems is installing a gem with C extensions, it builds them
during the install.  Since installing is done during the fake stage,
this meant that the extensions were getting built as root.

Previously, this was required, as gem's --user-install option was
broken.  However, since that option has now been fixed, we use
it to install the gem to a temporary location as the current
user during build, and then mv and chown the files during fake.

Thanks to bernd@ for pointing out that the fixed --user-install
option allowed this.

	sys/dev/ic     : ar5008reg.h ar9003reg.h 

Log message:
Add __attribute__((aligned(4))) to __packed Tx/Rx descriptors.
This makes gcc generate much more efficient code on architectures
with strong alignment constraints (like sparc64).
We use __packed to tell the compiler to not insert padding between
fields but the start of the descriptors is always 32-bit aligned.
When __packed is used, gcc assumes worst case scenario and generates
complicated code to prevent unaligned accesses.

Inspired by a similar change to ath9k.
Tested on sparc64.

For the record, example to set a field to 1 on a sparc64:
without __attribute__((aligned(4))):
ldub    [%g2], %g1
and     %g1, 0, %g1
stb     %g1, [%g2]
ldub    [%g2+1], %g1
and     %g1, 0, %g1

ldub    [%g2+2], %g1

Log message:
The base no longer uses old groff -- it uses mandoc(1).  The ports tree still
sometimes needs groff, but there it is pulled in as a build-dependency, and
it is the newer groff.  We are able to do this now due to the hard work if ingo.

Log message:
Remove the LOG_MAKEPRI macro.  It has been broken (the << 3 is wrong) since
the dawn of time.  A few systems fixed^Hchanged it, thus breaking other code.
Since the usage of it is now a mess, the right path from here on out is to
*remove* the macro forever and cope with the (very minor) fallout.

be run from the generic task kthread, because xfers that need to be
aborted block newly queued tasks from running (i.e. the xfer to be aborted
blocks the abort of that task).  as there are now three types of usb
tasks, add an argument to usb_init_task() and another member to struct
usb_task to specify the task type.

Log message:
    import keepassx 0.4.3
    
    KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on
    secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross
    platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public
    License.
    
    KeePassX saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords,
    URLs, attachments and comments in one single database. For a better
    management user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each
    single entry. Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are
    customizable as well. The integrated search function allows to search
    in a single group or the complete database.
    KeePassX offers a little utility for secure password generation. The
    password generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use.
    Especially someone who generates passwords frequently will appreciate
    this feature.
    
    The complete database is always encrypted either with AES (alias
    Rijndael) or Twofish encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key.
    Therefore the saved information can be considered as quite safe.
    KeePassX uses a database format that is compatible with KeePass
    Password Safe. This makes the use of that application even more
    favourable.

Removed files:
	infrastructure/db: config.x11.site 

Log message:
Bye bye USE_X11.
From now on, building ports requires X11BASE.

* lots of ports missed this variable (porters always have X11 installed)
jasper made a first pass on fixing these, but no doubt it will drift
away soon
* users should use packages
* people building ports should know what they are doing and having
X11BASE as a requirement is perfectly reasonnable
* we are merging config.x11.site into config.site because of a stupid
autofoo bug ; currently when USE_X11 is set, some ports may loose the
ability to even load config.site

    Mapnik is an OpenSource C++/Python toolkit for developing GIS

    Essentially a collection of geographic objects (map, layer,
    datasource, feature, geometry), the library doesn't rely on
    "windowing systems" and can be deployed in any server environment.
    It is intended to play fair in a multi-threaded environment and is

    This module enables you to make the Menu Settings required on specific
    content types. It forces a node from one or more content types to be
    included in the menu system before the content will be saved
    successfully. This can be useful in a number of situations, e.g. when
    using [menupath-raw] in the Pathauto settings, which expects a node to

    This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also

    The gnome-main-menu is a set of three utilities.  A gnome-panel applet
    similar to the traditional main-menu but a few addtions and changes.
    In particular the gnome-main-menu does not provide direct access to all
    the applications on the system, but rather displays user specified
    "favorites" and recently launched applications.

Log message:
big update to vmware tools functionality from jonathan matthew.

vmt(4) will now:
- initiate shutdown by signalling init with SIGUSR2 when requested by
the host.
- initiate a reboot by signalling init with SIGINT when requested by
the host.
- report the guests hostname to the host
- report the guests first non-loopback IP address to the host
- report the guests uptime to the host
- update the guests timedelta sensor using the 64bit rpc

vmt(4) now does the majority of what people actually need.

this has been tested on vmware server 2.0.2 with linux as the host,
vmware esx 4.0, and vmware esx 4.1
testing by jonathan matthew and myself. previous versions of the changes
were also tested by johan allard and srebrenko sehic.

The LDT is only used by dead compat code now, so load the ldt
register with the null selector (disabling use of it), stop reloading
it on every context switch, and blow away the table itself, as well
as the pcb and pmap bits that were used to track it.  Also, delete
two other unused pcb members: pcb_usersp and pcb_flags.  (Deleting
pcb_usersp also keeps the pcb_savefpu member aligned properly.)
Finally, delete the defines for the unimplemented AMD64_{GET,SET}_LDT
sysarch() calls.

Tested by various with both AMD and Intel chips

    Pulleys, Mobiles, Forces, ... . Use the SI and English systems,
    scientific notation and many conversion factors. The problems that can
    be solved with FisicaLab, are:
    
    * Kinematics of particles, include circular motion.
    * Static of particles and rigid bodies in 2D.
    * Dynamic of particles in 2D (doesn't include dynamic of circular motion)
    * Heat, calorimetry, ideal gas and expansion.

Log message:
Split library spec from MODRUBY_LIB_DEPENDS into MODRUBY_WANTLIB.
Also, if CONFIGURE_STYLE includes ext or extconf, update WANTLIB
and LIB_DEPENDS, and set SHARED_ONLY=Yes.  That configure style
is only used for ruby C extensions, which need those settings.
This cleans up a lot of ruby C extension ports, which will be
committed shortly.

Log message:
fix a possible NULL deref on loading a corrupt ECDH key

store ECDH group information in private keys files as "named groups"
rather than as a set of explicit group parameters (by setting
the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag). This makes for shorter key files and
retrieves the group's OpenSSL NID that we need for various things.

Log message:
    import ns4 4.3.6
    
    ns4 is a command line configuration management tool.  It allows the
    automated backup of node (i.e. routers and switches) configurations to
    an FTP/SFTP server or local media on a daily basis to create
    configuration archives. It can run ad-hoc commands on multiple nodes as
    well as custom scripts for automating complex tasks. It uses Perl and
    allows you to manipulate the output of commands using regular
    expressions within scripts.  Configuration based cartridges are used to
    specify new node types, allowing the user to extend its functionality in
    a simple and dynamic way.

Change basep parameter of getdirentries() to be off_t *, not long *

This requires adding a new getdirentries syscall, with the old one
renamed to ogetdirentries.  All in-tree consumers of getdirentries()
have been updated.  Bump libc and libpthread major numbers.

Log message:
proof-of-concept implementation of -R (rebuild when signature changes).
Somewhat inefficient (deep check of package vs port signature).
More proper approach would be to tell the engine to always build, have first
step be a check for signature if the package exist, and abort if it matches:
- here we double check everything
- propagating rebuilds means non-uptodate packages give rise to non uptodate.

	libexec/ld.so  : util.c 

Log message:
fix a 10 year old bug in the memory allocator, which affected only sparc.
sparc has 4 byte long, but needs 8 byte alignment.  recently the DIR
struct was changed to contain some off_t, which needs 8 byte alignment.
turns out the allocator calculated the bias for alignment, and then
subtracted out it's private linkage storage afterwards.  on hppa this
worked because a 8-byte object can be loaded at a 4-byte boundary; on
all other architectures the situation was either 4/4 or 8/8.
thanks for a bit of help from drahn

Modified files:
	usr.bin/cvs    : init.c rcs.c rcs.h 

Log message:
init was passing a writable file descriptor into rcs_open which was then
failing to fdopen() it as readable. It doesn't need to pass in the fd at
all, so just change it to pass -1 which makes cvs init work again.

In fact, the fd should never need to be writable - it is only used for
reading. RCS_WRITE triggers a rewrite on the file on rcs_close() but
this is done by using a temporary and rename(2) (RCS_WRITE is a poor
name for the flag). So while here, add a couple of comments to hopefully
make it a little clearer. There is some confusion about how this is used
in other places but checking those is a separate issue.

the engine queues everything to build, but normal build is only an

the package does not exist, or if its signature does NOT match the ports

Add a `pkgpath' field to installed GHC libraries. Only applies to
libraries not coming together with ghc. This allows for looking up
a library's PKGPATH by running

ghc-pkg field $pkgname pkgpath

where $pkgname is the GHC library name without the `hs-' prefix,
for example `ghc-paths'.

Log message:
    Oggz comprises liboggz and the tool oggz, which provides commands to
    inspect, edit and validate Ogg files. The oggz-chop tool can also be
    used to serve time ranges of Ogg media over HTTP by any web server that
    supports CGI.
    
    liboggz is a C library for reading and writing Ogg files and streams.
    It offers various features over the reference libogg, including
    support for seeking, validation and timestamp interpretation. Ogg is
    an interleaving data container developed by Monty at Xiph.org,
    originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio format but now used for
    many free codecs including Dirac, FLAC, Speex and Theora.

Modified files:
	usr.bin/aucat  : aparams.h 

Log message:
Add experimental support for 24-bit arithmetic, meaning that full
dynamic range of 24-bit hardware can be used. Offline processing like
mixing and channel mapping is done with 24-bit precision too.

Since most hardware and audio programs use 16-bit precision, 24-bit
processing is a small waste of CPU time in many cases, so 24-bit
processing is not desirable and this is disabled by default.
Furthermore it's available on i386, amd64 and sparc64 only. To
experiment with it:

make COPTS="-DADATA_BITS=24"

Log message:
Stop the auto* madness and bring this port inline with today's standards:
- use ${SUBST_CMD} instead of perl -pi
- remove auto*/aclocal*.am patches and only patch configure/Makefile.in.
- use @sample to install a config file instead of @cwd, and default
to sndio output
- remove auto* dependency, unbreaks it with new metaauto

    Import vmwh, a handy vmware userland helper for X.
    
    vmwh is a vmware helper for X11, developed on OpenBSD to run in userland
    alongside the vmt(4) vmware kernel driver and the vmmouse Xorg driver.
    It detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the host ("ungrabs")
    and sends the guest's X11 clipboard data (read from xclip) to the host
    through the vmware backdoor, which gets put onto the host's clipboard.
    It then detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the guest
    ("grabs") and replaces the X11 clipboard contents (via xclip) with the
    host's, which is read through the vmware backdoor.

painful, and since most ruby developers do not use the documentation
(preferring web documentation), it doesn't make sense to include them.

For most gem ports, a ruby 1.9 version can be built by using
the ruby19 FLAVOR, and a jruby version can be build using the jruby
FLAVOR.  These flavors modify the FULLPKGNAME to use either the
ruby19- or jruby- package stem, so you don't need to worry about
the ruby 1.8 package conflicting.

In most cases, you no longer need the PKGNAME set in the port
Makefile, as the FULLPKGNAME handling will take care of that for you.
Also, for pure ruby gems (without C extensions), PKG_ARCH = * is added
automatically.

Changes to all dependent ports will be committed shortly. For new
ruby ports, you need to make sure that gem dependencies are specified
like this (assuming they depend on the hoe gem):

:${MODRUBY_PKG_PREFIX}-hoe-*:devel/ruby-hoe,${FLAVOR}

MODRUBY_PKG_PREFIX will be ruby for ruby 1.8 ports, ruby19 for ruby
1.9 ports, and jruby for jruby ports.  The ,${FLAVOR} part at the end
makes sure that dependencies use the same version of ruby that
the current port uses.

PLISTs are going to become a lot smaller with this.  However, any
binaries installed by the gem need to have a special string added.
For example, the minitar binary installed by
archivers/ruby-archive-tar-minitar looks like this in the PLIST:

${GEM_BIN}/minitar${GEM_BIN_SUFFIX}

The ${GEM_BIN_SUFFIX} needs to be added manually so the package
works on ruby 1.9, which installs the binaries with a 19 suffix.

GEM_SKIPDEPENDS has been removed and related support will be removed
from devel/ruby-gems.  To modify dependencies inside the gem, the gem
metadata is placed under WRKDIST and can be modified with the standard
patching procedure.

code and remove some hacks that we don't need anymore
- also use --as-needed while linking (which results in at least a 50% speed
improovement)
- depend on more libraries from the system instead of using the internal

Log message:
Make sure that the initial configuration of the child is zeroed out
by using calloc(). This fixes an issue where the RDE would start up
as route-collector because uninitialized memory made the RDE switch
to that mode.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/acpi   : acpibat.c 

Log message:
The acpibat(4) notify function should not unconditionally call both _BIF
and _BST.  Some machines (like the Toshiba Satellite Pro U550 18F mentioned
in PR 6508) have AML that does a Notify(0x81) from the _BST method, which leads
to infinite recursion.  Instead call _BIF when the argument is 0x81 and call
_BST when the argument is 0x80 or 0x00 (the latter indicates we're polling).
Simplify the battery detection logic while there.

Log message:
revamp the way dependencies work
- strip extra : at start of depends (old LIB_DEPENDS are gone, right)
- rely on the fact, :extra is only patch|configure|build for any depends.
- use _parse_pkgspec to do things intelligently.
- _set_stem2default to handle STEM-*.

- switch internal stuff to new style.

This is backwards compatible. But this does require -current dpb, -current
sqlports, and -current pkg_add to work !

	shells         : Makefile 

Log message:
having tcsh,static again is a problem, as we made things transparently
update thru a pkgpath.
If ever we decide to build it again, remember to bump and tweak the
pkgpath.

consensus for no build from naddy/jasper.
should make theo future updates happy.

Log message:
least invasive round of cleanup:
- install drupal modules/themes as root:daemon rather than www:www
(only the files/ directory needs to be writeable by 'www').
- don't install 'settings.php' world-readable since it contains the
DB password. Use 640, owner 'www' instead.
- bump all modules.

tested in production, including upgrade szenarios.

Modified files:
	sys/net        : route.c 

Log message:
If the interface address referenced by a cloning route did not point
to an interface any more, the kernel crashed with a null pointer
dereference.  This situation could be created by a strange sequence
of route and ifconfig commands.
Now when a cloning route references a stale interface address and
rtrequest1(RTM_RESOLVE) has to create a cloned route, it does a
lookup for a valid interface address with the same ip address.  The
new interface address and its interface are used for the new cloned
route and they replace the old ones at the cloning route.

written at n2k10 in australia in january, but had to be backed
out. the offenders have been fixed:
-ipvshit rtsol code calling these functions in interrupt context
(surprised this hasn't caused more havoc)

-sloppy recycling of ifaddrs in some places

Log message:
    Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language.
    
    The Rubinius bytecode virtual machine is written in C++, incorporating
    LLVM to compile bytecode to machine code at runtime. The bytecode
    compiler and vast majority of the core classes are written in pure Ruby.
    
    To interact with the rest of the system, the VM provides primitives
    which can be attached to methods and invoked. Additionally, FFI provides
    a direct call path to most C functions.
    
    Rubinius uses a precise, compacting, generational garbage collector. It
    includes a compatible C-API for C extensions written for the standard

Add a patch from Debian bug #590760:
Let the client check if the daemon is already running instead of just
trying to start it, which doesn't work if there is no service file (the
service file is just meant for systems using system.d).

This fixes avahi-browse as well as "bonjour/zeroconf" support in several
applications.

Issue also pointed by Greg Jones.

	sys/arch/vax/vax: bus_dma.c mem.c 

Log message:
This is a first step towards getting rid of avail_start and avail_end in the
kernel, currently limited to low-hanging fruit: these variables were used
by bus_dma to specify the range in which to allocate memory, back when
uvm_pglistalloc() was stupid and would not walk the vm_physseg[].

Nowadays, except on some platforms for early initialization, these variables
are not used, or do not need to be global variables. Therefore:
- remove `extern' declarations of avail_start and avail_end (or close cousins,
such as arm physical_start and physical_end) from files which no longer need
to use them.
- make them local variables whenever possible.
- remove them when they are assigned to but no longer used.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/wscons : wscons_callbacks.h wsdisplay.c wskbd.c 

Log message:
Change wsdisplay_kbdinput() to get an aray of keysym_t and a count, instead of
a single keysym_t at a time - this means tty sanity checks will only happen
once.

Introduce wsdisplay_rawkbdinput() for raw mode input, since raw input is
a byte array. As a bonus this allows us to skip the `is this a KS_GROUP_Ascii
value' test in that case.

Log message:
synch with reality, somewhat:
- infrastructure scripts have moved, and resolve-lib has never been part
of lib-depends-check.
- LIB_DEPENDS is less likely than RUN_DEPENDS to affect directory removal
in update-plist (it will only do so for SHARED_ONLY ports)
- inter-subpackages dependencies are totally handled, and there's no way
to put libraries in front of LIB_DEPENDS anymore.
- document the new dir/foo>=version

- remind people that version numbers must go forward.

- why do people insist on using make search ?
make key=value is so much better.
- fix LIB_DEPENDS example, which never worked anyways

	sys/scsi       : cd.c 

Log message:
SCSI devices are assumed to be T_FIXED unless they say otherwise.
cd(4) did not believe any T_FIXED device was its responsibility.
Thus when a USB CD forgot to mention that it is T_REMOV, it appeared
as uk(4).

Make cd(4) accept even T_FIXED devices that claim to be T_CDROM or
T_WORM.

Noticed and fix tested by Rene Maroufi. Closes PR #6513.

that only applies to automatic-resize windows, so just dispose of it
entirely.

Fixes problems reported by Nicholas Riley.

    Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software.
    Based on guarded atomic actions (similar to STM), Atom enables highly
    concurrent programming without the need for mutex locking. In addition,
    Atom performs compile-time task scheduling and generates code with
    deterministic execution time and constant memory use, simplifying the
    process of timing verification and memory consumption in hard realtime
    applications. You can now program your Arduino with Haskell. [..]

Log message:
Floating-point emulation code for systems lacking proper FPU (i.e. Octeon),
enabled by option FPUEMUL.

This is pretty straightforward, except for conditional branch on FPU condition
codes emulation (bc1f/bc1fl/bc1t/bc1tl instructions): unlike most
RISC-with-delay-slots designs (m88k, sparc), the branch pipeline is not exposed
to the kernel on Mips, therefore we can not resume a branch without losing the
delay slot instruction.

Some other operating systems work around this issue by emulating the delay
slot instruction, but this is error-prone (and requires the kernel code to
be aware of all supported instructions of the processor it is currently running
on), some use dedicated breakpoints to single-step through the delay slot and
then resume the branch as expected, but this causes a lot of copy-on-write
allocations.

This code chooses a third path, of copying the delay slot instructions to run toa special `magic' page, followed by a special trap instruction to give control
back to the kernel. This makes sure the instruction will actually be run by the
processor, and that no more than one page per process is wasted, regardless of
the number of branches to emulate.

Tested on octeon (big-endian) by syuu@ and on loongson (little-endian) by me.
Note that enabling option FPUEMUL in the kernel will completely disable the
hardware FPU, if there is one; there is currently no way to build a kernel
supporting both hardware and software FPU, and there is no reason to change
this until there is a strong need to support both.

Log message:
Add a PKGSPEC entry to restrict ports depending on lang/ruby/1.8 to
depend on ruby-1.8 and not ruby-1.9.  This PKGSPEC is slightly
different from the previous one used in ruby.port.mk, so all

In addition, since the subpackages depend on the -main package and
also had a slightly different pkgspec, they need to be bumped as well.

Log message:
Remove MODRUBY_PKGSPEC, rely on the PKGSPEC entries specified
in lang/ruby/1.*/Makefile.

Also, add the ability to pass CONFIGURE_ARGS to gem install.
These get passed to the extconf.rb scripts that create the
Makefiles for C extensions, and may make it easier to port
gems with C extensions without resorting to patching.

Log message:
REVISION bump all ruby ports due to a change in the pkgspec.
Previously, we were using ruby->=1.8,<=1.9, instead of
ruby->=1.8,<1.9.  While this wouldn't cause an issue, since
our ruby-1.9.2 package isn't included in ruby->=1.8,<=1.9,
it's still wrong and should be fixed.  This also fixes the
following minor issues:

Switch from using FLAVOR to MODRUBY_FLAVOR for *_DEPENDS.
Currently we don't have a ruby port that uses FLAVORs that
would differ from MODRUBY_FLAVOR, but it's possible we will
in the future.

Switch from BASE_PKGPATH to BUILD_PKGPATH in a few cases in
REGRESS_DEPENDS.  This probably is not strictly necessary, but
BUILD_PKGPATH is used in more cases, so it is good for
consistency.

Switch to new style *_DEPENDS, with the version specification
at the end.  The remaining cases where this is not done is
because a specific version is used.

Some FULLPKGNAME added to REGRESS_DEPENDS, to make sure that if
the old version is installed when you run a regress test, it
will install the new version first.

Some conversion of spaces to tabs for consistency.

	usr.bin/mandoc : main.c roff.c roff.h 

Log message:
Implement the .de (define macro) roff instruction.
This fixes various Xenocara manuals.
Do not define your own macros in new manuals, though:
this code exists purely to cope with existing and old stuff.

Like in both traditional and GNU roff, the .de and .ds (define string)
roff instructions share the same string table, so one can abuse strings
as macros and vice versa.  This implementation supports multi-line
user-defined macros and user-defined macros taking up to 9 arguments.

Project started near the end of p2k10, now mature for production,
but there is still room for future improvements in various respects.

Log message:
Make .de1 a symnonym for .de, not .ig as it was before.

The .de1 instructions is a GNU extension not found in traditional roff and
not even in old groff, defined as "define a macro that will be executed with
traditional roff compatibility mode switched off during macro execution".
Since we ran into it in the wild, we have been parsing and ignoring it for
a long time.  Now that we have proper .de support, we can as well use the
contents, even though we don't implement compatibility mode at all.

Log message:
Add a nasty little hack to make keyboard selection work for Swiss keyboard
encodings and the Canadian French one. The way XkbLayout and XkbVariant
work for this encodings changed some long time ago and the result was
that you would end up with no keyboard at all in X. Now XkbVariant includes
part of the layout selection which is about as ugly and makes the wscons
mapping a bit tricky.

Log message:
Misaligned load/store recovery code in the kernel, enabled by T_FIXALIGN
userland traps on a per-process basis, were necessary for *some* SunOS
binaries on sparc, which had to compiled with explicit misaligned access code
generation (i.e. for vendors to release a working SunOS/sparc version of their
code until they could fix their bogus code).

There is no reason to keep this code on sparc64, and now that we don't provide
COMPAT_SUNOS anymore, there is no reason to keep this code on sparc.

Modified files:
	usr.bin/mandoc : roff.c 

Log message:
Two related bugfixes:

1) When using a user-defined string of length 0 as a macro,
do not access memory before the start of the string (segfault).

2) When beginning to define a user-defined macro, initialize
the string representing the macro to the empty string,
not to the NULL pointer, such that, in case the macro turns
out to not have any content, like in
.de IX
..
the macro will be defined and empty instead of undefined.

This avoids large numbers of bogus mandoc ERROR messages about
undefined macros (which are actually defined and empty), in
particular in man(7) code generated from pod2man(1), for example
in Perl and OpenSSL.

Log message:
To avoid FATAL errors, we have been parsing and ignoring the roff
requests .am, .ami, .am1, .dei, and .rm for a long time.
Since ignoring them can (rarely) cause information loss and serious
misformatting, throw an ERROR: NOT IMPLEMENTED when finding them.
Implementing them would not be too difficult, but they are so rare
in practice that i can find better use for my time right now.

In this context,
- Put the string "NOT IMPLEMENTED" into two other error messages
as well, to distinguish them from those caused by broken input.
- Print the string "unknown macro" once, not twice in the error message
associated with MANDOCERR_MACRO, and begin printing the buffer at the
point where the unknown macro really is, not at the start of line.

Log message:
Rename the pmap_growkernel() current limit variable from virtual_end to
pmap_maxkvaddr, to mimic what other pmap_growkernel()-capable pmaps do,
and to reduce confusion with what virtual_end (used to) mean.

Log message:
Implement the roff .ft (change font) request for man(7).
Of course, we don't want to encourage low-level physical markup,
but pod2man(1) writes such requests, so Perl manuals contain them,
and some Xenocara and lots and lots of ports manuals use them as well.
In base and Xenocara, this will reduce mandoc -Tlint ERROR noise;
in ports, it will improve rendering of many manuals.

Log message:
Downgrade the easier of the two cases of MANDOCERR_SYNTLINESCOPE
to MANDOCERR_LINESCOPE, i.e. from FATAL to ERROR.

That is, when an element next line scope is empty except for one
or more NSCOPED macros (like in .B .br .br .B), throw away the
empty element including its NSCOPED children such that the parser
can prod on.

While here, improve the error message and tell the user which element
has been thrown away.

Log message:

m_pullup.

not really a significant change since most rx bufs (which we read pfsync
packets from) are a single contig cluster coming off the network, so we
rarely hit the case m_pullup was called in.

    This module adds PHP-based password strength checking and validation
    routines that mirror the jQuery routines, so that administrators can
    restrict passwords to only be, for example, "high" strength. The module
    simply modifies existing password confirm fields (where two passwords
    are entered, like the user edit form), so no other setup is required
    beyond configuring the desired enforcement rules.

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/relayd: check_tcp.c hce.c log.c relay.c relayd.c 
	                 relayd.h 

Log message:
The relayd processes did already bump up the socket file descriptor
resource limits to the maximum of the daemon class but the host check
process (hce/health checks) didn't and was limited to a fairly low
default of 128 open sockets (openfiles-cur=128 in login.conf). This
was reached fairly quickly with "check tcp" of many hosts. This diff
increases the maximum number of monitored hosts and concurrent health
checks in relayd in a significant way and may fix issues for people
that have around 100 or more hosts (or fewer hosts with multiple checked
ports).

Log message:
Clarify the internal ibuf API: rename ibuf_copy() to ibuf_get() because
it returns a new buffer from the internal read offset like stdio get
functions do and not the same buffer when it is called multiple times.
Also rename the old ibuf_get() to ibuf_getdata() because it returns
a "special" data type and it matches the stdio get* conventions.

Log message:
move vers.o to before the other objects, so that it is not linked last.
having it linked last is bad (on at least i386 and amd64) because the lapic
is mapped over the start of the data segment -- savecore(8) then reads the
version string for a fixed buffer space, and reads into the lapic area
causing unintended side-effects (at least on Intel X5570 and X5680)

Modified files:
	sys/nfs        : nfs_syscalls.c 

Log message:
Make sure we only initialize the nfsrv_descript_pl pool once.
Re-initializing the pool everytime nfsd(8) terminates is very bad since it
screws up the list of pools resulting in infinite loops when traversing that
list.  Issue found by Daniel Melameth.

	sys/arch/amd64/amd64: dkcsum.c 

Log message:
the boot loader passes a variable that identifies the disk its
booting off made up of a bunch of fields like adapter, controller,
disk, and partition offsets, plus a table of all the disks it can
see which includes this id and a checksum.

the kernel goes through and checksums the disks and then maps that
back to the id associated with that disk, and then compares some
of the fields in those ids against the boot disks id to figure out
which disk its on.

the problem is we overflow one of those fields (the disk id one).
since the other fields are set to 0 by the boot loader, this doesnt
really matter that much. however, since those fields are now
significant because of the overflow, we should compare them too.

this prevents sd16 being matched as the boot disk after sd0 on my
system with 25 disks attached.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/amd64/include: cpufunc.h 

Log message:
The rdmsr_locked/wrmsr_locked functions were using "=A" as a constraint for
the 64-bit output/input.  On i386, this means that the 64-bit value is in
eax:edx, but on amd64 gcc this is not the case (might be a gcc bug, or might
be intentionally different and annoying?).  The consequence is that amd64
errata were not always being matched (and then "corrected" using the magic
repair code).  We need to compose/decompose the 64-bit value like the
un-locked msr functions do.

Log message:
    Import ruby-rack-mount, one of the dependencies for Rails 3.
    
    Rack::Mount is a stackable dynamic tree based Rack router.  Rack::Mount
    supports Rack's +X-Cascade+ convention to continue trying routes if the
    response returns pass. This allows multiple routes to be nested or
    stacked on top of each other. Since the application endpoint can trigger
    the router to continue matching, middleware can be used to add arbitrary
    conditions to any route. This allows you to route based on other request
    attributes, session information, or even data dynamically pulled from a
    database.

Log message:
The PF_KEY socket is like the routing socket. It must be polled all the

messages that are needed are lost. This fixes an infinit loop in

also runs a larger IPsec setup.

    Import chroma 1.13:
    
    Chroma is an abstract puzzle game. A variety of colourful shapes are arranged
    in a series of increasingly complex patterns, forming fiendish traps that must
    be disarmed and mysterious puzzles that must be manipulated in order to give up
    their subtle secrets. Initially so straightforward that anyone can pick it up
    and begin to play, yet gradually becoming difficult enough to tax even the
    brightest of minds.

Log message:
Allow quote macros (`Op', `Aq', `Bq', `Dq', `Pq', `Ql', `Qq', `Sq', and
`Brq') to have zero arguments without warning.  This makes sense because
the multi-line quote macros (`Oo/Oc' etc.) allow zero children anyway.
Furthermore, the documentation doesn't state that they're required to
have children.

    Filesys::Notify::Simple is a simple but unified interface to get

    inotify2 on Linux and fsevents on OS X if they're installed, with a
    fallback to the full directory scan if they're not available.
    
    (note from importer: it could use a kqueue/libevent backend instead of a
    gross full scan every 2 secs, which is not even configurable :)

Log message:
    Import libguess-1.0
    
    libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of
    the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can
    be checked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte
    to each DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character set can
    be deduced as efficiently as possible.

Log message:
Allocate a full C compiler-style stack frame that includes space for 6
extended word argument slots required by the ABI.
Apparently gcc4 uses them in cases where gcc3 didn't.  Fixes segmentation
faults with gcc4 because the space for the slots was colliding with
the space for dl_data that we allocated on the stack.

Log message:
    import hs-blaze-builder 0.2.1.1
    
    This library provides an abstraction of buffered output of byte streams
    and several convenience functions to exploit it. For example, it allows
    to efficiently serialize Haskell values to lazy bytestrings with a large
    average chunk size. The large average chunk size allows to make good use
    of cache prefetching in later processing steps (e.g. compression) and
    reduces the sytem call overhead when writing the resulting lazy
    bytestring to a file or sending it over the network.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/mips64/mips64: exception.S 

Log message:
Remove superfluous SAVE_CPU_SREG()/RESTORE_CPU_SREG() around ast() call in
u_general exception handler.  The SAVE_CPU_SREG() is actually harmful, since
it overwrites any changes made to to s0-s8 in the trapframe by ptrace(2).
Fixes some issues with GDB.

There seems to be an annoying runtime regression with session bus after
the last update which I failed to see in my tests.
While this is being worked on, let's revert for now so that people don't
run into it. Other parts of the D-DBus gang update are fine (glib and
python). Also keep the recent rc script tweak.

Sorry about that...

Log message:
MFC, original commit from claudio@:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Be more careful when copying the pf rule from userland into the kernel.
All pointers in the struct need to be cleared and reset. So instead of
bcopy the struct and clear some fields start with a clean struct and
assign the values that need to be copied.
Fixes a local vulnerability but only root can issue the problematic ioctl().
Reported by Jean Sigwald, has been in snaps for a while and OK deraadt@

preventing packages that won't install (much easier to fix that when
you still have the fake tree around !)

specifically, look into depend that are installed, and possibly in the
fake tree: if the package does build, it requires the libraries to be
around anyways, so pure RUN_DEPENDS are not an issue (and avoid old libraries,
if we find wantlib only in .lib, something really fishy is going on).

Reuse the Dependencies class, so we're sure to have the exact same way
to find libraries.

Also fix exit codes from pkg_create...

    o Flat Profiles - similar to the reports generated by the standard
    Ruby profiler
    o Graph profiles - similar to GProf, these show how long a method
    runs, which methods call it and which methods it calls.
    o Call tree profiles - outputs results in the calltree format

    Import ruby-fast-stemmer 1.0.0, dependency of ruby-jekyll
    
    Fast-stemmer is simply a wrapping around multithreaded Porter stemming
    algorithm.
    
    This gem adds a String#stem method, and it conflicts with the stemmer
    gem.  It's in order of magnitude faster (and uses much less memory) than
    the latter.

    Import ruby-liquid 2.2.2, dependency of ruby-jekyll
    
    Liquid is a template engine which I wrote for very specific
    requirements:
    
    * It has to have beautiful and simple markup. Template engines which
    don't produce good looking markup are no fun to use.
    
    * It needs to be non evaling and secure. Liquid templates are made so
    that users can edit them. You don't want to run code on your server
    which your users wrote.
    
    * It has to be stateless. Compile and render steps have to be seperate
    so that the expensive parsing and compiling can be done once and later
    on you can just render it passing in a hash with local variables and
    objects.

Log message:
mvme88k kernels running on 88110 systems have been prone to panicing for
``invalid opcode'' in kernel mode after being idle for a few hours, since
many months already. This panic does not make sense.

Recently, I've been able to gather enough samples and, looking at the
instructions surrounding the panic location, I have narrowed a pattern,
and I'll conveniently blame these panics upon a (to the best of my
knowledge) new genuine 88110 bug.

The exception handler will now recognize this situation and apply a large
hammer of workaround - probably not the best workaround that could be devised,
but it's short, easy to implement, and works 100% of the time so far. Besides,
since the machine is idle, who cares as long as it keeps running?

(the curious reader will find more information in the trap.c comments)

Keep a session index which is used in a couple of places internally but

    This goal of this project is to provide a consistent interface to LBL's
    libpcap packet capture library. This project was created because the
    currently available ruby-pcap library is poorly designed and has been
    unmaintained since 2000. This does not provide packet processing
    functionality, it simply provides the interface for capturing packets.
    This version has been forked by the Metasploit project.

Log message:
The exception vector page on m88k systems has always been the same page as
the one used by the firmware, which (at least on mvme88k) is at address zero.

This is unfortunate, since this means that NULL pointer dereferences in the
kernel are not caught, and writes cause havoc.

This behaviour was necessary to be able to use the PROM system call interface
during early bootstrap, without having to disassemble the VBR page and
update branches - which use pc-relative displacement - if we were to use
a different VBR address.

On mvme88k, change this and actually set up two VBR pages: one, over the PROM
page (except for the system call vectors), and another one in the kernel
image (which will be mapped read-only). We'll run with the PROM page until
the end of autoconf, and then switch to the kernel one, and unmap all the
PROM below it.

As a bonus, the final kernel page can use optimized data access fault
handlers, which do not have to check for faults caused by badaddr(), since
badaddr() is only used during device probe on buses which do not support
hotplug.

	etc/rc.d       : rc.subr 

Log message:
Fix a flaw in the rc.subr framework reported by stephan@ where
local_rcconf would get overwritten by flags from the rc script itself.

Based on an original idea and diff from robert@, create an rc_conf
function that we add in the rc_script after the defaults daemon*
variables.
This way we can use defaults variables names in other part of the script
(when defining a specific pexp for instance).

While here, simplify setting up the default daemon variables so that we
don't need to do any substitution in rc_start.

rc scripts must include daemon variables before calling rc_conf. All
other locally modified variables (pexp, rc_reload, local additions...)
must come after.

feedback from and works for sthen@
ok robert@

Log message:
Kill pmap_phys_address(), and force every driver's mmap() routine to return
a physical address [more precisely, something suitable to pass to pmap_enter()'sphysical address argument].

This allows MI drivers to implement mmap() routines without having to know
about the pmap_phys_address() implementation and #ifdef obfuscation.

Log message:
Do not issue a cache maintainance operation until the last one is not
completed; this used to be the case, but revision 1.25 of this file, close
to four years ago, changed this behaviour by mistake. The side effects of this
mishandling of the cache did not show up until the kernel memory allocation
strategy moved towards fast reuse of freed pages.
Took me a while to track this down, maybe I'm getting too old to write code,
I probably should write backdoors instead.

Log message:
make mpii properly detach devices, which helps a lot if they have commands in flight. to relevant changes are:

- call the activate(DVACT_DEACTIVATE) function against all the luns
on the target that is going away as soon as possible.
- issue the target reset BEFORE detaching the children devices.
this is needed now tha the midlayer will sleep until all outstanding
commands on a device come back from the adapter before calling the
child devices attach routine.

implement timeouts of scsi commands.

timed out scsi commands get put on a list and an iohandler is
scheduled.  that iohandler pulls the timed out scsi command off the
list and issues a task management request to kill all outstanding
io on the target with the timed out io.

all io killed as a result of this request will be returned to the
midlayer with their status set to XS_RESET, which in turn will cause
the midlayer to retry the command. this relies on the previous
commit.

As schwarze@ also stated, this will prevent anyone from calling it

a functions container.

No functionnal change, unless you were calling rc_conf from an rc script
which would have been wrong anyway.

Log message:
Since we save the interrupt mask in the trapframe when we get a trap, we
might restore the wrong mask when we switch CPUs.  Since we should be
running with the proper mask when we enter $syscall_return, simply save
the proper mask into the trapframe such that we restore the right interrupt
mask later on.

reenabled at CMMU initialization time.
- better granularity in the 88110/88410 routines, to operate on ranges closer
to the actual requested area, errata permitting.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/m88k/m88k: pmap.c 

Log message:
Handle writethrough mappings (as opposed to writeback) better:
- a writeback->writethrough downgrade only requires a cache writeback, not a
writeback and invalidate.
- apparently the 88200 does not behave correctly (i.e. according to its
documentation) when a given page is accessed with both writethrough and
writeback cacheability (even though the cache lines are physically indexed
and physically tagged), so make sure to force writeback of writeback pages
when they risk being reused as writethrough (hair_count -= MAXHAIR).

Better coherency in page table backing store cacheability: these need to be
cache invalidated on 88100+88200 (because of hardware update of modified and
used pte bits), and writethrough on 88110.

Log message:
Massive overhauling of the m88k pmap, though I can't pretend it's a new pmap
since a large part of the structures and logic remains.

Since m88k has separate supervisor/user spaces, we can map physical memory 1:1
in supervisor space, and have the kernel virtual address space start from the
end of physical memory.

This allows us to switch to __HAVE_PMAP_DIRECT. And to get rid of the double
mapped sdt, since now their virtual and physical addresses will always match.

The upper bound of the kernel virtual memory space is now platform dependent,
until the code which relies upon some hardware devices being mapped 1:1 in
supervisor mode is updated to no longer require this (this is mainly a PITA on
luna88k, where onboard devices start at 0x40000000, leaving only 1GB of KVA at
the moment - still much better than the previous 512MB).

Tested on mvme88k only (187, 188, 197LE, 197DP). Other platforms ought to
work, aviion will be checked shortly and fixed if necessary. No known
OpenBSD/luna88k system in working condition at the moment.

because from the point of view of roff, man macros are just roff macros,
hence their arguments are parsed in exactly the same way.

While doing so, fix these bugs:
* Escaped blanks (i.e. those preceded by an odd number of backslashes)
were mishandled as argument separators in unquoted arguments to
user-defined roff macros.
* Unescaped blanks preceded by an even number of backslashes were not
recognized as argument separators in unquoted arguments to man macros.
* Escaped backslashes (i.e. pairs of backslashes) were not reduced
to single backslashes both in unquoted and quoted arguments both
to user-defined roff macros and to man macros.
* Escaped quotes (i.e. pairs of quotes inside quoted arguments) were
not reduced to single quotes in man macros.

OK kristaps@

Note that mdoc macro argument parsing is yet another beast for no good
reason and is probably afflicted by similar bugs.  But i don't attempt
to fix that right now because it is intricately entangled with lots of
unrelated high-level mdoc(7) functionality, like delimiter handling and
column list phrase handling.  Disentagling that would waste too much
time now.

Log message:
Partial cleanup of argument count validation in mdoc(7):

Looks fine to kristaps@.

Note that the macros using eerr_ge1() still need to be checked at a later
time; but as all the others are done, let's use what we already have.

Log message:
Clean up and simplify tmux command argument parsing.

Originally, tmux commands were parsed in the client process into a
struct with the command data which was then serialised and sent to the
server to be executed. The parsing was later moved into the server (an
argv was sent from the client), but the parse step and intermediate
struct was kept.

This change removes that struct and the separate parse step. Argument
parsing and printing is now common to all commands (in arguments.c) with
each command left with just an optional check function (to validate the
arguments at parse time), the exec function and a function to set up any
key bindings (renamed from the old init function).

This is overall more simple and consistent.

There should be no changes to any commands behaviour or syntax although
as this touches every command please watch for any unexpected changes.

Affecting only -Tascii:
* The .IP and .TP HEADs must be printed without literal mode,
but literal mode must be restored afterwards.
* After the .IP and .TP bodies, we only want term_newln(), not
term_flushln(), or we would get two blank lines in literal mode.
* The .TP HEAD does not use TWOSPACE, just like .IP doesn't either.
* In literal mode, clear NOLPAD after each line, or subsequent lines
would get no indentation whatsoever.

Affecting only -Thtml:
* Only print next-line .TP children, instead of all but the first.

This allows immediate responses (e.g. NOP-out) to be issued with a task
instead of very special code. Also set expstatsn on all PDU that carry
it.

Log message:
Implememnt NOP-IN -> NOP-OUT handling. If the NOP-In was issued by the
target (itt = 0xffffffff) send back an immediate NOP-Out reusing the
NOP-In PDU. This makes my iscsi target happy.
Also plug a mem leak on error path which was found by Igor Zinovik.

Log message:
Some fixes from upstream:

- imap: Fixed a memory leak in ESEARCH.
- imap/pop3-login: Don't crash if passdb returns proxy field without host.
- lib-index: Added a missing sanity check for expunge-guid record's uid.
This fixes a non-self healing assert-crash.
- master: Delete also pipes from login_dir (left by v2.0).

in arc4_stir() only grab 64 bytes from the MD5 output.  Grabbing more
does not substantially increase the quality of the RC4 state. These
days we may have lots more userland libc's initializing themselves,
or lots of largebuf kernel calls which re-initialize their own RC4,
and thus deplete the MD5 more than originally intended.

Log message:
This updates rubinius to 1.2.0.  Among other things, a few of our
patches were accepted upstream.

Rubinius previously installed into a versioned directory, this
update changes it to install into an unversioned directory.
This is going to change the PLIST of all dependent gem ports,
and a commit for them as well as a commit for ruby.port.mk will
be going in shortly.

Minor versions of rubinius do not maintain binary compatibility,
so we'll still need to bump all dependent ports that use C
extensions whenever the minor version of rubinius is updated, but
it is better than bumping all dependent ports.

While here, add some CONFIGURE_ENV stuff to make it possible to
build more ports with C extensions that depend on libraries in
LOCALBASE/lib.

this adds preliminary support for the Atheros AR9271 chipset and
probably the AR9280+AR7010 and AR9287+AR7010 too though those were
not tested.
scanning still takes a very long time (~1 sec per channel) but
otherwise, operation in STA mode seems stable.
will implement fast channel change soon.

committed over the Ubiquiti WifiStation EXT (AR9271) on i386 with WPA.
requires firmware (see man page for details)

substantial rewrite.  put a very thin mutex at the entropy-collection
side so that entropy events can come in from any kernel context.  place
a 2nd very thin mutex at the call-down path as well, so that any context can
request random data.  in the middle, meet with a bcopy that has no mutex,
but copying unlocked data is actually a benefit.
move the pool->MD5->RC4init sequence into a workq driven from a timeout,
so that we can do all the heavy work without any mutex held or IPL; only
grab the 2nd mutex to swap to a new RC4 state. (this workq design from tedu)

Modified files:
	usr.bin/nc     : nc.1 netcat.c 

Log message:
Support unix domain sockets in nc(1) with -Uu.

Previously, using -U with -u was an error that was not documented
in the man page.  Now it will use a unix socket in datagram mode.

Bidirectional unix datagram communication requires a socket at
both ends, so in client mode (without -l), a temporary socket is
created so that responses from the server can be received.
If -s is specified with -U and -u, it specifies the location of
the temporary socket to create.

This was mostly written way back in 2007.  Since then, various
improvements implemented based on suggestions from guenther@,
tedu@, and nicm@. Man page help from nicm@ and jmc@.

Unix datagram support requires a small change to atomicio.c
in order to function correctly, this will be committed separately
shortly.

Log message:
OK, this is getting silly, but we might as well zero the entropy buffer
supplied by root (it can be large enough to overwhelm the entropy buffer,
and we are doing a re-key almost immediately)

Log message:
Fix a bad heritage from ospfd. Make neighbors independent of interfaces.
They are not bound as strongly as in ospf and causes problems when the
TCP connection is established from an not connected IP (e.g. a loopback).
Use three RB trees to sort the neighbor list by id, addr and peerid.
More cleanup is needed but this makes ldpd work against peers using
loopback IPs. Problem found, reported and fix tested again by Marcel Wiget.

Log message:
Some nfe(4)/rlphy(4) combos don't work, because the PHY responds to all
addresses on the mii bus.  As a countereasure, only attach the first PHY we
encounter.  It is very unlikely we're going to ever see nfe(4) with multiple
PHYs.  The same is probably true for any modern NIC.

Log message:
Add a patch doing PRAGMA secure_delete ON when opening connection to
sqlite database. Allows us to build against system sqlite3 again, and
get rid of the infamous symbol size mismatch warning reported several
times on ports@.
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445164 for why mozilla
now hard-requires secure_delete, and
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546162 for the reasons they
don't want to make that an option and forces us to do such hacks.

Log message:
    import obc-2.9.1
    
    Oberon-2 is clean and simple programming language.
    This is portable compiler that translates Oberon-2 into bytecode, which
    can be either interpreted or dynamically translated into machine code.
    Dynamic translation uses a portable interface modelled on the one in GNU
    Lightning, but is so far implemented only on x86 machines.  The
    implementation includes a full garbage collector, and comes with
    profiling tools and a simple GUI debugger.

the serial number is now available in struct usb_device_info, so
there's no need to use the USB_REQUEST ioctl to get the serial number.
this also means usbdevs can open /dev/usb* read-only, instead of

Log message:
Merge from bsd.lv, original commit message by kristaps@:
Change how -Thtml behaves with tables: use multiple rows, with widths
set by COL, until an external macro is encountered.  At this point in
time, close out the table and process the macro.  When the first table
row is again re-encountered, re-start the table.  This requires a bit of
tracking added to "struct html", but the change is very small and
follows the logic of meta-fonts.  This all follows a bug-report by
joerg@.

Log message:
* instead of NULLing pointers to interface descriptors in the uaa, mark
interfaces as being claimed in the usbd_device's copy of the interface
descriptors
* allow ugen(4) to be attached if there are unused interfaces in a
configuration that has had drivers attached
* make ugen(4) aware that it may be sharing a device with (an)other
driver(s), and if so:
* do not let ugen(4) change the configuration
* do not let ugen(4) access the already claimed interfaces

Log message:
patch from Henri Kemppainen:
clean up undo boundaries for functions in random.c
This catches an error, where twiddling in an empty file could
disable undo boundaries for the rest of the session.
proper undo boundaries around newline() will have to wait until
proper reference counting is done... Thanks!

Log message:
Reimplement the iked(8) policy evaluation for incoming connections to
use the last matching semantics of PF.  The previous rbtree-based
implementation was broken and tried to do a longest prefix match.  But
instead of prefix match and using radix-trees to fix it I decided with
mikeb@ to implement it as last matching policy evaluation.  The last
matching policy wins; the "quick" keyword can enforce first matching;
additional keywords like "skip" are specific to iked(8).  See
iked.conf(5) for more details.

The implementation also uses skip steps based on PF's code.  It
significantly speeds up the evaluation of many policies but also adds
a little delay when loading them (only noticeable with thousands of
policies).  This allows iked(8) to scale well with thousands of
configured policies but I also liked the fact to have skip steps in
another piece of code.

Log message:
Add support to installboot(8) for installing biosboot(8) and boot(8) on
softraid volumes. If installboot is run on a softraid volume, a fake
single inode FFS filesystem is constructed to contain boot(8). This is
then installed onto the softraid volume via the BIOCINSTALLBOOT ioctl.
biosboot(8) is then patched and installed onto each disk that is a member
of the softraid volume.

Joint work with otto@ who came up with the concept of constructing a fake
FFS filesystem and wrote the code to do so.

Log message:
Simplify the way jobs work and drop the persist type, so all jobs are
fire-and-forget.

Status jobs now managed with two trees of output (new and old), rather
than storing the output in the jobs themselves. When the status line is
processed any jobs which don't appear in the new tree are started and
the output from the old tree displayed. When a job finishes it updates
the new tree with its output and that is used for any subsequent
redraws. When the status interval expires, the new tree is moved to the
old so that all jobs are run again.

This fixes the "#(echo %H:%M:%S)" problem which would lead to thousands
of identical persistent jobs and high memory use (this can still be
achieved by adding "sleep 30" but that is much less likely to happen by
accident).

- Before exiting walreceiver, ensure all the received WAL is fsync'd to disk.
Otherwise the standby server could replay some un-synced WAL, conceivably leading
to data corruption if the system crashes just at that point.

Log message:
SECURITY update to 1.3.07.11 - CVE-2011-0520

The compress_add_dlabel_points function in dns/Compress.c in MaraDNS 1.3.x
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long DNS hostname with a large
number of labels, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

Changes by:	schwarze@cvs.openbsd.org	2011/02/07 14:58:15

Modified files:
	util/cf        : OpenBSD.cf 

Log message:
As noticed by david@, empty files were installed instead of formatted
GL manuals because Imake still tried to use nroff(1), tbl(1), and eqn(1)
which do not exist in base any longer.  Thus, let the Xenocara build use
mandoc(1) instead, which has native tbl(7) support, and passes eqn source
code through unchanged for now, which is more useful than what groff did.
However, as suggested by espie@, use the groff port when building Ports.
That always works because all ports using imake still have USE_GROFF=Yes.

thanks for useful hints to todd@ matthieu@ espie@ naddy@
tested by todd@ in Xenocara builds on i386, amd64, and macppc
ok matthieu@ and naddy@, and miod@ also agrees with the general direction

Log message:
late update to chromium 9, robert@ did the work, but he doesn't have the
time right now.
Tree is still locked!
Reasons for the update:
- good work that can be used now
- only builds on i386/amd64, and they're fast
- multiple security problems in old chrome
- old chrome half working, can't break it more than it was.

This one requires resources (see MESSAGE), but it's ways more stable.

Again, discussed with sthen@, jasper@, naddy@, miod@

bring back changes in usb.c revision 1.73
date: 2011/02/04 08:21:39;  author: jakemsr;  state: Exp;  lines: +85 -34
* merge 'onqueue' and 'running' members of struct usb_task into
a new member, 'state'.
* add new function 'usb_wait_task()', which waits for queued or running
usb_tasks to complete.
* in the USB_DEVICEINFO ioctl, fill struct usb_device_info in a
usb_task, thereby avoiding races against driver attach/detach.

but this time make the state a bitmask, since it is valid to be added
to the task queue while the task is running.  also be more careful
about waking up the task when state changes.

Log message:
fix from pr 6207.  a bit more of an explanation: we write the correct
number of bits when connecting via a SOCKS 5 proxy over ipv6, but we
also need to read the same number depending on the received address
type.  this issue is not noticeable with ssh's SOCKS 5 support since it
always set the address type as ipv4.  this fixes connections via SOCKS 5
proxies which set their address type as ipv6 when using ipv6.

Add workaround for BCM5906 A0/1/2 controller silicon bug. When

on the ethernet link may cause internal chip delays that may result
in subsequent valid frames being dropped due to insufficient
receive buffer resources. The workaround is to choose de-pipeline
method as a flow control decision for SDI. De-pipeline method
allows only 1 data in TxMbuf at a time such that a request to RDMA
from SDI is made only when TxMbuf is empty.

in sync with the physical world. De-syncing noted by drahn@ while

Log message:
back out r1.162, the one that bumps openings up on sas and fc
devices.

my theory is that some devices report queue full conditions in ways
the firmware doesnt understand, or some firmwares default to NOT
doing the queue full handling internally. either way it reports
queue full conditions as faulted io which gets passed up to the
block layer as errors.

this makes us conservative again and safe.

this fixes panics from ajacout
