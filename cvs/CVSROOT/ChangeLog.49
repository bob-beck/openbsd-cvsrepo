Log message:
Unrevert post-unlock:
* Prevent an archive from esacaping the current directory by itself:
when extracting a symlink whose value is absolute or contains ".."
components, just create a zero-length normal file (with additional
tracking of the mode and hardlinks to the symlink) until everything
else is extracted, then go back and replace it with the requested
link (if it's still that zero-length placeholder).

* For tar without -P, if a path in the archive has any ".." components
then strip everything up to and including the last of them (if
it ends in ".." then it becomes ".")
This mostly follows GNU tar's behavior, except for 'tar tf' and
'tar xvf' we report the modified path that would be/was actually
created instead of the raw path from the archive

Above two fixes prompted by a report from Daniel Cegielka
(daniel.cegielka (at) gmail.com)

* For directories whose times or mode will be fixed up in the
clean-up pass, record their dev+ino and then use
open(O_DIRECTORY)+fstat() to verify that we're updating the correct
directory before using futimens() and fchmod().

* Correct buffer overflow in handling of pax extension headers,
caught by the memcpy() overlap check.

Log message:
Switch pv entries over to a pool in preparation for making the i386 (more)
mpsafe.  Most (all?) other architectures now use pools for this, including
non-direct pmap architetcures like sparc and sparc64.  Use a special back-end
allocator for pool pages to solve bootstrapping problems.  This back-end
allocator allocates the initial pages from kernel_map, switching to the
uvm_km_page allocator once the pmap has been fully initialized.  The old
pv entry allocator allocated pages from kmem_map.  Using the uvm_km_page
allocator avoids certain locking issues, but might change behaviour under
kva pressure.  Time will tell if that's a good or a bad thing.

Log message:
Fix a regression caused in rev. 1.118, reported by kristaps@:

When using a pager and the first manual shown is gzip'ed,
the gunzip(1) process ended up as a child of the pager process
such that the man(1) process couldn't wait for it, preventing
proper display of the manual.

Solve this by making the pager a child of the man(1) process
(instead of the other way round), which requires being a bit
more careful about properly closing file descriptors after use
and waiting for the pager before exiting man(1).

Log message:
Switch the netstat view of systat to use the same kvm_getfiles()
function similar to netstat(1). The output still shows the same
info but may be a bit differently sorted. Also it will now show
connections that are not UDP or TCP.  This was the last bit of
systat that needed kvm access and so now systat no longer needs
to be setgid kmem.
With this commit OpenBSD is officially setgid kmem free and an
almost 10 year journey finally comes to an end.

If while attaching pckbdc device slots, we find a slot has failed to
attach and it happens to be the AUX port, aha: we are a kernel without
the pms driver.  In that case, we should reset that pms back into
'stupid mode'.  It seems some BIOS initialize newer-style nubbins/touchpads
into strange (advanced) modes, which can muddle up the pckbc pipe.  This
is experienced as 10-second typing pauses and strange repeat behaviour on the
RAMDISK, but was eventually tied to "lightly brushing" the touchpad...

Log message:
TZ_MAX_CHARS in the old tzfile.h bears no resemblence to the actual
max time zone length used by libc/time.  Just use PATH_MAX for now
(since zone files are path names).  This function is slated to be
removed at the next libc major bump.

Log message:
tzfile.h is an internal header that should never have been installed.
What's worse, the tzfile.h that gets installed is over 20 years old
and doesn't match the real tzfile.h in libc/time.  This makes the
tree safe for /usr/include/tzfile.h removal.  The TM_YEAR_BASE
define has been moved to time.h temporarily until its usage is
replaced by 1900 in the tree.  Actual removal of tzfile.h is pending
a ports build.  Based on a diff from deraadt@

Log message:
Avoid a NULL pointer deref when X509_get_pubkey() returns NULL.

A NULL pointer could be dereferenced when X509_REQ_set_pubkey() calls
X509_PUBKEY_set() with pktmp.

OpenSSL says it's the fix for CVE-2015-0288, but there aren't any public
details yet to confirm.  Either way, we should fix this.

Based on OpenSSL commit 28a00bcd8e318da18031b2ac8778c64147cd54f9
and BoringSSL commit 9d102ddbc0f6ed835ed12272a3d8a627d6a8e728.

Log message:
Revert 1.39.  Resetting after specifically putting the keyboard in a
different table will most likely just revert the keyboard to its
default table anyway.

Instead, just flush the kbd slot before choosing a table and then
still forcefully enable the slot, which is enough to fix UKC on the
3rd gen X1 carbon while having a much smaller chance of breaking
anything else.

	usr.bin/mandoc : main.c read.c 

Log message:
When the user exits the pager before the pager has drained all input
from man(1), man(1) dies from SIGPIPE.  Exiting man(1) is fine in this
case, generating more output would be pointless, but without handling
SIGPIPE, the exit code from man(1) was wrong and csh(1) printed an
ugly message "Broken pipe".  Fix this by handling SIGPIPE explicitly.

Log message:
Initialize nameservers ports along with nameservers addresses.

Missing initialization, as hinted by lwres_conf_clear().  Not present
in recent bind versions (the code has changed since).
This fixes an erratic behaviour when no (valid) nameserver is configured
in resolv.conf (dig / nslookup send requests to 127.0.0.1:48830).

Problem reported by Pawel S. Veselov who also provided an alternative diff.

Log message:
The innocuous change to libsa printf.c (1.26) causes printf.o to be 240 bytes

Since bootxx only needs printf for very simple panic() message involving %s
and %d format specifiers only, compile a -DSTRIPPED version of printf.c for
the use of bootxx. This makes bootxx return to a manageable size (it is even
8 bytes shorter now).

Modified files:
	lib/libcrypto/crypto/arch/hppa: Makefile.inc 

Log message:
In the neverending saga of enabling and disabling assembler code for sha
routines on hppa, the cause for sha512-parisc subtly misbehaving has been
found: despite having fallback pa1.1 code when running on a 32-bit cpu, the
shift constants used in the sigma computations in sha512 are >= 32 and are
silently truncated to 5 bits by the assembler, so there is no chance of
getting this code to work on a non-pa2.0 processor.

However, the pa1.1 fallback code for sha256 is safe, as it never attempts to
shift by more than 31, so reenable it again.

    Import megatools-1.9.94.
    
    Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from a
    command line of your desktop or server.
    
    Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory
    trees to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads
    for example to preview videos and audio files, without needing to
    download the entire file.
    
    Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega
    servers allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at
    minimum.

Log message:
remove the congestion handling from struct ifqueue.

its only used for the ip and ip6 network stack input queues, so it
seems unfair that every instance of ifqueue has to carry a pointer
around for this specific use case.

this moves the congestion marker to a kernel global. if we detect
that we're congested, we assume the whole system is busy and punish
all input queues.

marking a system as congested is done by setting the global to the
current value of ticks. as the system moves away from that value,
it moves away from being congested until the comparison fails.

	sys/arch/sparc/sparc: autoconf.c machdep.c pmap.c trap.c 

Log message:
Rework the virtual memory layout on SRMMU systems (sun4d/sun4m) to use a much
lower VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS, since these systems are not crippled by the
Sun-4 MMU hole and have the real 4GB of address space.

Kernels running on Sun-4 MMU are not affected and will still be restricted
to the existing 128MB of kernel space, with 1GB - 128MB of user space.

Kernels running on SRMMU will now provide the low 3GB of address space to
userland, and use the top 1GB for the kernel, except when compiled with
option SMALL_KERNEL, in which case they will keep Sun-4 style the layout
(this is temporary to allow for people to boot bsd.rd to upgrade even when
not running 2.10 boot blocks, and will be removed eventually)

A consequence of this is that the top of the userland stack is no longer at
0xf0000000. But since nothing in userland uses USRSTACK anymore, this should
not be an issue.

Tested on sun4c and various sun4m, with physical memory sizes ranging from 32
to 448MB.

Log message:
Instead of embedding interface names in a sockaddr use their indexes
when adding route entries with the -link option.

This prevent the ARP layer to take the name of your interface for an
Ethernet address.  If you still want to add stupid content to your
routing table, please write your own tool.

Thanks to Henk Jan Agteresch for reporting the original issue and
testing this diff.

this was backed out because of fallout on landisk which has since
been fixed. putting this in again early in the cycle so we can look
for more fallout. hopefully it will stick.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/ic     : re.c 

Log message:
some re(4) chips can do jumbos, but none of them can checksum jumbo
packets.

rather than disable cksum offload for all packets, this sets things
up so we still advertise offload to the stack, but if the driver
gets a large packet it does the checksum itself in software.

small (normal sized) packets still get offloaded like now. if you're
doing a jumbo you'll be doing the cksum in software, but will
hopefully win overall cos you'll be doing a 6th of the work cos
you're doing more data in every packet.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/ic     : re.c rtl81x9reg.h 

Log message:
add support for jumbos on re(4).

this uses hints from the freebsd driver, but the implementation
differs.

freebsd manages two lists of rx descriptors. one for "normal" packets
and the other for jumbos. this continues to use a single list and
uses a per softc variable and MCLGETI to always allocate what the
chip is capable and uses it unconditionally.

other than that, we just need to enable some bits in some registers
to be able to do jumbos.

this relies on the previous commit to properly deal with checksum
offload for packets of different sizes.

	sys/dev/acpi   : acpi.c 

Log message:
The ACPI standard says that a PCI function number of FFFF can be used to refer
to all functions on a device.  This makes no sense in the context of accessing
PCI config space.  Nevertheless stsp@ has a machine with AML that tries to
do config space reads from a device where _ADR encodes function number FFFF.
This is almost certainly buggy AML, but since Linux (and presumably Windows)
boot just fine on this machine we need to work around this.  Linux effectively
treats function FFFF as function 7, which isn't present on this machine.
Instead we simulate a read from a non-existent device by returning a bit
pattern of all ones.  Writes to function FFFF will still panic.

Log message:
Make sure we reset all relevant state when resetting or stopping an interface.
Our reset function did not reset the ring and LDC map and our stop function
did not reset the LDC channel state and the some of the ring state.  Also
make sure we clear IFF_OACTIVE whenever we re-establish a connection on the
LDC channel.  Finally, initialize the link state to LINK_STATE_DOWN such
that interfaces that have not been configured yet, don't show up as active.

This should improve the reliability of re-establishing network connections
between domains after some sort of hickup considerably.

Log message:
ldpd: Don't assign labels for BGP routes.

Although RFC 5036 is not explicit about this, LDP should not assign
labels for BGP routes. Doing that would be very resource consuming
in some scenarios and unnecessary. The goal is generally only to
establish LSPs among all PEs in the AS since LDP is not used as an
end in itself but as a means to implement advanced solutions like
MPLS L2/L3 VPNs. Some implementations (e.g. JunOS) go further and
only assign labels for /32 loopback routes advertised in the IGP.

If Inter-AS LSPs are necessary, BGP itself should be used for
distributing IPv4 labeled routes (e.g. option C. of section 10 in
RFC 4364).

Log message:
Remove interface finite state machine.

In the name of simplicity, remove the interface FSM that was inherited
from ospfd. In ldpd interfaces are just up or down, so keeping a
FSM for that is an overkill. Now instead of calling if_fsm(), just
call if_update() whenever a relevant event occurs (status change,
address addition/removal).

Additional notes:
1 - s/if_act_/if_/

2 - Remove the IMSG_IFUP and IMSG_IFDOWN events. Now whenever an
interface changes its state a IMSG_IFSTATUS event will be generated
with the new status.

	sys/arch/sparc/dev: sbus.c sbusvar.h 

Log message:
When an IOMMU is not available, and an sbus board has register ranges not
reachable with the default slot aperture (such as hme(4) devices, which have
their registers at offset 0x08c00000 from the slot base), force the attachment
of the device to fail.

While hme would fail early due to being unable to talk on the mdio bus, hme+esp
boards would have the esp part of the board get nuts and would spin during
autoconf. Of course, you are not supposed to use such boards on sun4c, because
(as mentioned above) they can't run without an iommu.

Add a no_ssl flavour to allow a non-SSL build (SSL doesn't really add
much in the case of NRPE as no authentication is done anyway).

	sbin/ping      : ping.c 

Log message:
obfuscate the monotonic clock values we put on the wire by offsetting
them with a random value.

picking between ^ and +- as the operator for the obfuscation has
turned out to be a great bikeshed. im picking + and - cos it prevents
observers seeing high bits roll over which can indicate the magnitude
of the current clock value.

discussed with many.

this raises the size of the default ping payload from 16 to 24bytes,
but claudio@ thinks we'll be fine with this.

Still not enough to get the sound working in such systems but get rid of
the annoying "i2s_set_rate: timeout" message during boot and plugging an

Log message:
Expand ehci_{add,del}_intr_list() macros.

ehci(4) is using a TAILQ_* to keep track of the pending transfers.  In
this context "pending" means submitted to the hardware.  Now that we
are no longer fiddling with the internal of the TAILQ_* there's no good
reason to keep these macro, but more importantly this will let us reuse
the 'inext' field to get rid of the other hand-rolled lists of xfers.

No functional change.

Log message:
unifdef -U NO_DPROMPT and GOSREC.
NO_DPROMPT has been around since the import of mg2a and it has never been
considered a "(Common) compile-time option" in the Makefile.
Assume everyone has been running mg this way since at least 2000 if not
already in the 90s.

Same with GOSREC. Has always been there but it looks like no one noticed
it (and no one was running with it). Indeed, the mg tutorial appears to be
oblivious to GOSREC being an option.

With this commit there are no more #ifndef blocks in mg. Only a couple of
#ifdef blocks remain.

    OpenConnect VPN server (or ocserv) implements the AnyConnect SSL VPN
    protocol and is compatible with the OpenConnect VPN client. Its purpose
    is to be a small, secure and configurable VPN server that depends on
    standard protocols like TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS. The AnyConnect
    SSL VPN protocol was the closest protocol to match this requirement.
    
    The VPN users can be authenticated using password, certificate
    authentication or both methods. Authenticated users are assigned their
    own unprivileged worker process and obtain a networking (tun) device
    and IP from a configurable pool of addresses.

Modified files:

	sys/netmpls    : mpls.h 

Log message:
Use rt_ifa_add(9) and rt_ifa_del(9) to configure MPLS labels.

Since the removal of the link-layer ifa from "struct ifnet" it was
impossible to configure MPLS routes on mpe(4).  Because just like
enc(4), mpe(4) was abusing the link-layer ifa to attach its route
entries.

So explicitly pass a "glue" ifa to the routing layer.

From Rafael Zalamena who discovered this the hardway, thanks!

Log message:
The code in socks.c writes multiple times in a row to a socket. If the
socket becomes invalid between these calls (e.g. connection closed), write
will throw SIGPIPE. With this patch, SIGPIPE is ignored so we can
handle write's -1 return value (errno will be EPIPE). Ultimately, it leads
to program exit, too -- but with nicer error message. :)

Update to next major release 0.2.6.6.

Changes in version 0.2.6.6 - 2015-03-24
Tor 0.2.6.6 is the first stable release in the 0.2.6 series.

It adds numerous safety, security, correctness, and performance
improvements. Client programs can be configured to use more kinds of
sockets, AutomapHosts works better, the multithreading backend is
improved, cell transmission is refactored, test coverage is much
higher, more denial-of-service attacks are handled, guard selection is
improved to handle long-term guards better, pluggable transports
should work a bit better, and some annoying hidden service performance
bugs should be addressed.

    Import libutf8proc-1.1.6.
    
    utf8proc is a library for processing UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings.
    Some features are Unicode normalization, stripping of default ignorable
    characters, case folding and detection of grapheme cluster boundaries.
    A special character mapping is available, which converts for example the
    characters "Hyphen" (U+2010), "Minus" (U+2212) and "Hyphen-Minus"
    (U+002D, ASCII Minus) all into the ASCII minus sign, to make them equal
    for comparisons.

Log message:
Add a bus_dma_tag_t for DVMA usage, suitable for use for devices not sitting
behind a sun4m iommu.

Move the existing dvma routines from vm_machdep.c to this new dvma.c; this
allows for a few declarations to be removed from public headers.

Extend the device attachment arguments (struct confargs) to pass a
bus_dma_tag_t. mainbus receives the dvma bus_dma_tag_t, and devices pass the
tag unchanged to their children, except for iommu(4) which replaces it with
its own.

Change the few sun4m-only drivers to pick the bus_dma_tag_t from confargs
rather than assume iommu; this allows qlw(4) to attach and work on sun4c.

Log message:
The combination of -c and -o is not specified by POSIX. In fact, the call
"sort -o file -c file" has unspecified behavior and would leave an empty
file behind if it was sorted, the original file it was not.

If -c (or -C) has been specified, only perform that action and ignore -o
among other arguments.

While at it, clean up check() internals.

Log message:
Use SIGINT instead of SIGTERM to terminate the tor process in rc_stop().

For clients, this means no change.

For relays, this instructs tor to do a clean shutdown, leaving 30s for other
peers to find another route.  Increase daemon_timeout to one minute to give
tor a bit more time on slow machines (like my BBB).

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/ldpd  : lde_lib.c ldpd.h 

Log message:
Show the full LIB in the "ldpctl show lib" command.

The LIB is a table where the router keeps all known MPLS labels. So,
we should loop over all the received label mappings from all neighbors
to show the full LIB.

The lde_nbr_is_nexthop() function was introduced to verify if a lib
entry is supposed to be installed in the fib (according to the fib entry's
nexthop and the addresses advertised by the lib entry's nexthop). This is
better than keeping track of lib<->fib entries with pointers and back
pointers because it keeps the lib/fib structures independent of each
other, which in turn makes the code less prone to bugs.

Log message:
Remove lo protection.

There's no need to protect the 127/8 network on ldpd since this network
is filtered before being sent to lde.

If we receive a label mapping for this network, it won't be installed
because lde has no nexthop for it, and thus the code will always fall
into the LMp.13 case of the RFC "Receive Label Mapping" algorithm:
the mapping will be recorded but not used.

Log message:
Rounding rules for horizontal scaling widths are more complicated.
There is a first rounding to basic units on the input side.
After that, rounding rules differ between requests and macros.
Requests round to the nearest possible character position.
Macros round to the next character position to the left.

Implement that by changing the return value of term_hspan()
to basic units and leaving the second scaling and rounding stage
to the formatters instead of doing it in the terminal handler.

Improves for example argtable2(3).

    The gSOAP toolkit provides a cross-platform software development toolkit for C
    and C++ server and client Web service applications, and simplifies the overall
    use of XML in any type of application. The toolkit supports SOAP 1.1/1.2 RPC
    encoding and document/literal styles, WSDL 1.1, MTOM/MIME/DIME attachments
    (streaming), SOAP-over-UDP, request-response and one-way messaging. The toolkit
    also supports WS-Addressing and WS-Security, with several other WS-* available
    or under development.

Log message:
Another round of reducing diffs with Linux.  This one moves the various
copy_to_user and copy_from_user functions into drm_linux.h and uses them
instead of copyin/copyout and DRM_COPY_*.  Also move the timespec functions,
and put i915_gem_object_is_purgable() where it belongs.

Uncovered a bug where the arguments to copyout() were in the wrong order.

Log message:
    Import rust 1.0.0beta, all the hard work from SÈbastien Marie (thanks!)
    
    Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
    almost all crashes, and eliminates data races.
    
    Featuring:
    - zero-cost abstractions
    - move semantics
    - guaranteed memory safety
    - threads without data races
    - trait-based generics
    - pattern matching
    - type inference
    - minimal runtime
    - efficient C bindings
    
    some packaging tweaks by me, ok/testing bcallah@ jca@

    Fish Fillets NG is strictly a puzzle game. The goal is always the same:
    find a safe way out. The fish utter witty remarks about their
    surroundings, the various inhabitants of their underwater realm quarrel
    among themselves or comment on the efforts of your fish. The whole game
    is accompanied by quiet, comforting music.

Make pthread_atfork() track the DSO that called it like atexit() does,
unregistering callbacks if the DSO is unloaded.  Move the callback
handling from libpthread to libc, though libpthread still overrides the
inner call to handle locking and thread-library reinitialization.
Major version bump for both libc and libpthread.

Log message:
introduce a garbage collector for (very) idle pool pages.

now that idle pool pages are timestamped we can tell how long theyve

seconds so it can free them.

this idea probably came from a conversation with tedu@ months ago.

Log message:
Better handling of package flavors, treat flavors as properties instead
of a parameter to the resources. Fixes detection of installed package flavors,
and adds the flavor of a package to "puppet resource package" output.

Better handling of service_flags on service configuration, now allow to configure/set
flags before starting a service the first time. That makes services work that require
parameters to start up, and prevents services from running with wrong parameters.

	sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64: pmap.c 

Log message:
I believe UVM is clean now and no managed pages should be in use anymore
when we call pmap_release().  Turn debug code into printf and remove the code
that tried to mop up.  Override Debugger() such that it inserts a trap
instruction directly into the code such that we get useful backtraces.

This way I don't need to worry about pmap_release() removing pv entries when
making this pmap mpsafe.

Log message:
security update to ntp-4.2.8p2
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#Recent_Vulnerabilities

CVE-2015-1798 "When ntpd is configured to use a symmetric key to authenticate a
remote NTP server/peer, it checks if the NTP message authentication code (MAC)
in received packets is valid, but not if there actually is any MAC included."

CVE-2015-1799 "An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with each
other (symmetric association) can send a packet to host A with source address
of B which will set the NTP state variables on A to the values sent by the
attacker. Host A will then send on its next poll to B a packet with originate
timestamp that doesn't match the transmit timestamp of B and the packet will be
dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for both hosts, they won't be
able to synchronize to each other."

Log message:
Update to rakudo 2015.03, on MoarVM.  This port is no longer based on the
'star' distribution, but on plain rakudo.  Module precompilation at the
fake stage is too ugly and brittle, and upstream encourages packagers to
provide modules as individual packages.

So here's a bare-bones rakudo.  Panda and other stuff will follow eventually.

Log message:
mpi@ introduced a ph_cookie in mbuf packet headers that can be used
by a subsystem to stash some state while the mbuf gets queued. eg,
net80211 uses it to keep track of the wireless node associated with
a packet before submitting it to a drivers snd queue for transmission.

this makes pipex use ph_cookie to keep track of the pipex session
associated with a packet before submitting it to the softint queues.
this lets us get rid of an mbuf tag type, and avoids the cost of
tag allocation.

Log message:
replace the use of ifqueues for most input queues serviced by netisr
with niqueues.

this change is so big because there's a lot of code that takes
pointers to different input queues (eg, ether_input picks between
ipv4, ipv6, pppoe, arp, and mpls input queues) and falls through
to code to enqueue packets against the pointer. if i changed only
one of the input queues id have to add sepearate code paths, one
for ifqueues and one for niqueues in each of these places

by flipping all these input queues at once i can keep the currently
common code common.

Log message:
Send OPENSSL_issetugid() straight to hell, no final cigarette.

The issetugid() API is supposed to make a strong promise where "0
means it is safe to look at the environment".  Way back in the past
someone on the OpenSSL team responded to the environment access danger
by creating a wrapper called OPENSSL_issetugid, and went to use it a
number of places.  However, by default on systems lacking true
issetugid(), OPENSSL_issetugid returns 0.  0 indicating safely.  False
safety.  Which means OPENSSL_issetugid() fails to make any sort of
promise about safety, in fact it is just the opposite.

Can you believe the OpenSSL team?

This nastiness was noticed over the years, however noone could gain traction
and get it fixed in OpenSSL.  Also see a paragraph about this in
http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/worst-common-denominator-programming

Log message:
Directly handle ioctls issued to a SCSI device associated with a softraid
volume, ignoring any device name specified in the bio(4) ioctl struct.

One of bio(4)'s design flaws is that the device name is hardcoded in many
of the ioctl structs, making it basically unusable with DUIDs. In the case
of `bioctl -d' the bioctl(8) code actually uses opendev(3) on the given
name, then issues the ioctl directly to the resulting device. As such, we
already know which device (or in this case, softraid volume) the ioctl was
intended for, however the current softraid(4) code ignores this and instead
attempts to perform a lookup using the name in the bio(4) ioctl struct.

This diff splits the sr_bio_ioctl() code into two parts - one that implements
the API required by bio(4) and the other that contains the ioctl handling
code, which now takes an optional pointer to the softraid discipline. If an
ioctl is issued to a SCSI device associated with a softraid volume, pass
the corresponding softraid discipline struct through and to the bio ioctl
handler and use it in preference to performing a device name lookup.

Amongst other things, this makes bioctl -d now work with DUIDs.

Log message:
Bring PAE code back to life, in a different form. This diff (via bluhm then
to deraadt, then myself) brings the PAE pmap on i386 (not touched in any
significant way for years) closer to the current non-PAE pmap and allows
us to take a big next step toward better i386 W^X in the kernel (similar to
what we did a few months ago on amd64). Unlike the original PAE pmap, this
diff will not be supporting > 4GB physical memory on i386 - this effort is
specifically geared toward providing W^X (via NX) only.

There still seems to be a bug removing certain pmap entries when PAE is
enabled, so I'm leaving PAE mode disabled for the moment until we can
figure out what is going on, but with this diff in the tree hopefully
others can help.

The pmap functions now operate through function pointers, due to the need
to support both non-PAE and PAE forms. My unscientific testing showed
less than 0.3% (a third of a percent) slowdown with this approach during
a base build.

Discussed for months with guenther, kettenis, and deraadt.

Log message:
Let nl_langinfo(CODESET) return "US-ASCII" as the name of the
character codeset for the POSIX/C default locale.  This is the
preferred IANA name and also used by FreeBSD.

The previous value "646" was an obscure reference to ISO 646 (= ASCII)
and was not recognized by GNU iconv out of the box.

Log message:
Simplify, now that nl_langinfo(CODESET) returns "US-ASCII" instead
of "646" as the charset of the C/POSIX locale: This removes the
patches to libiconv's internal hash tables and adds US-ASCII to
config.charset, for the benefit of whatever GNU code uses this--
libiconv itself has "US-ASCII" built in.

The "INSTALL_DATA=cp" override has also been obsolete since we
started running the fake install as non-root.

	sys/net        : if_ethersubr.c if_bridge.c if_vlan.c 

Log message:
Move one "#ifdef NVLAN" chunk needed only if you're running bridge(4) on
to of vlan(4) from ether_input() to bridge_input().

One of the goal of the if_input() plumbing is to stop doing all possible
pseudo-drivers checks on every packets.  There's no reason that even if
you're not running a bridge(4) you've to run this code.

This change also will also makes it easier to convert vlan(4) to if_input().

Log message:
Remove support for storing credentials and auth information in the kernel.

This code is largely unfinished and is not used for anything.  The change
leaves identities as only objects referenced by ipsec_ref structure and
their handling requires some changes to support more advanced matching of
IPsec connections.

No objections from reyk and hshoexer, with and OK markus.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/usb    : umcs.c 

Log message:
Setting the configuration in *_attach() is a bad practise because if it
fails it's impossible to debug and you cannot use your device.

So instead of calling usbd_set_config_index(), match the right interface.

This is trivial with this device because it has only one configuration
and interface.

Log message:
Add libepoxy a library for handling gl/glx/egl function pointer management.
This is needed by glamor egl in the xserver which is in turn needed
to get acceleration with some hardware on xf86-video-ati.

Worked on during s2k15.  Glamor is not yet enabled in the xserver,
but adding this now as libepoxy recently showed up in ports.

The libepoxy port will be removed and ports will transition to
this version.  The xenocara version will be enabled when we're
ready to transition.

Log message:
Avoid using inet_ntoa() twice in a single printf() parameter list

Log message:
Use ether_ifattach() and ether_ifdetach() when cloning/destroying an
interface instead of rewritting most of them.

This change is also needed for upcoming if_input() conversion.

As a bonus pseudo-driver attached on top of carp are now detached in
the right order.

Modified files:
	lib/libtls     : tls.c 

Log message:
Make tls_close() more robust - do not rely on a close notify being received
from the other side and only return TLS_READ_AGAIN/TLS_WRITE_AGAIN if we
failed to send a close notify on a non-blocking socket.

Otherwise be more forceful and always shutdown/close the socket regardless
of other failures. Also do not consider ENOTCONN or ECONNRESET to be a
shutdown failure, since there are various situations where this can occur.

Log message:
Clean up the ssl_bytes_to_cipher_list() API - rather than having the
ability to pass or not pass a STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *, which is then either
zeroed or if NULL a new one is allocated, always allocate one and return it
directly.

Inspired by simliar changes in BoringSSL.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/alpha/alpha: mutex.c 
	sys/arch/alpha/include: mutex.h 

Log message:
while trying to reproduce lockups on mp alpha i hit an
MUTEX_ASSERT_UNLOCKED, but it turns out alpha mutexes arent very
friendly to diagnostics on smp systems.

alpha mutexes contained an mtx_lock member. when 0 the mutex was
unlocked, and when 1 it was locked. the MUTEX_ASSERT_UNLOCKED checked
if mtx_lock was 1 to see if the current cpu owned the mutex, but
in an mp system another cpu may have set mtx_lock to 1, which causes
the assert to fire.

this changes alpha mutexes so they record which cpu owns the lock
rather than just if the lock is held or not. the diagnostics compare
the owner to the current cpus curcpu() address so they can actually
tell if the current cpu holds the lock instead of whether any cpu
holds the lock.

instead of using custom asm to implement a cas this uses atomic_cas_ptr,
which on alpha uses gcc cas code. miod says he has far more confidence
in the gcc cas than the code that was there before.

while im here i also shuffled the code. on MULTIPROCESSOR systems
instead of duplicating code between mtx_enter and mtx_enter_try,
mtx_enter simply loops on mtx_enter_try until it succeeds.

this also provides an alternative implementation of mutexes on
!MULTIPROCESSOR systems that avoids interlocking opcodes. mutexes
wont contend on UP boxes, theyre basically wrappers around spls.
we can just do the splraise, stash the owner as a guard value for
DIAGNOSTIC and return. similarly, mtx_enter_try on UP will never
fail, so we can just call mtx_enter and return 1.

replace the hand rolled lists of mbufs in hfsc_classq with an

hfsc lists are very clever because they manage a fifo with a single
pointer by abusing the m_next pointer of the tail mbuf to point to
the head. clever but hard to read.

mbuf_lists are slightly bigger because they explicitely track the
head mbuf, but i got us that space back by inlining hfsc_classq
into hfsc_class and removing the unnecessary classq field.

(I don't think i ever fixed a seventeen-year-old bug in a port
before this one.  Naddy would say, "Nobody reads manuals, not even
the author of the manual."  Or the porter.  Not even in OpenBSD.
More's the pity.)

	sys/arch/amd64/include: cpu.h 

Log message:
It seems that the CPUID lies about the monitor-line size, or at least our
interpretation of it isn't quite right.  So instead of allocating memory
and slicing it based on the parameters returned by CPUID, simply use a member
in struct cpu_info like basically all other OSes out there do.  Our struct
cpu_info is large enough to never cause any overlap.  This makes the
mwait-based idle loop actually work.  We still execute the CPUID instruction
to make sure monitor/mwait is properly supported by the hardware we're
running on.

Log message:
add a mac to the timestamp payload and calculate it with siphash.

this lets us have some confidence that the timestamp hasnt been
damaged or tampered with in transit.

Modified files:
	sbin/ping      : ping.c 

Log message:
by default fill the ping payload with a chacha stream instead of
an unvarying payload.

each ping process generates a random key, and each packet then uses
the timestamps mac as the IV for the stream.

this allows us to have a different payload per packet that we can
recalculate and compare in the same was as the static payload was
checked before. by aggressively varying the payload we hope to
generate more opportunities for dodgy network equipment to show
errors.

note that we do siphash before chacha because we want to be strict
about the timestamp payload, but we want to be able to recognise
errors in the rest of the payload and where those errors were. doing
chacha before siphash would have us than fail the whole packet if
a checksum doesnt match.

Log message:
Update x11/qt5 to 5.4.1. Improvements included:

* Builds fine when another version being installed;
* Start building documentation, HTML generator bug was fixed (patch is
waiting for inclusion upstream);

This update do NOT include QtWebEngine: it relies on building from
Chromium sources (bundled with Qt5) and is a real pain to proceed; so lets
concentrate on what we already have.

All dependant ports are checked by building and running.

Log message:
Add support for x2apic mode

This is currently only enabled on hypervisors because on real hardware, it
requires interrupt remapping which we don't support yet. But on virtualization
it reduces the number of vmexits required per IPI from 4 to 1, causing a
significant speed-up for MP guests.

Log message:
Rewrite of tmux mouse support which was a mess. Instead of having
options for "mouse-this" and "mouse-that", mouse events may be bound as
keys and there is one option "mouse" that turns on mouse support
entirely (set -g mouse on).

See the new MOUSE SUPPORT section of the man page for description of the
key names and new flags (-t= to specify the pane or window under mouse
as a target, and send-keys -M to pass through a mouse event).

The default builtin bindings for the mouse are:

bind -n   MouseDown1Pane select-pane -t=; send-keys -M
bind -n MouseDown1Status select-window -t=
bind -n   MouseDrag1Pane copy-mode -M
bind -n MouseDrag1Border resize-pane -M

To get the effect of turning mode-mouse off, do:

unbind -n MouseDrag1Pane
unbind -temacs-copy MouseDrag1Pane

The old mouse options are now gone, set-option -q may be used to
suppress warnings if mixing configuration files.

Log message:
Always call rt_ifa_dellocal(9) when removing an IPv6 address.

The routing layer already check for the correct ifa when asked
to delete a local route, so do not try to be clever here.

This change also prevent having a NULL ifp pointer in your routing
table when you delete loopback interfaces having the same address.

Modified files:
	sys/netinet6   : in6.c 

Log message:
Do not treat loopback interfaces as p2p interfaces and create only
one route to "::1".

Due to a clever BSD trick, the `ifa_dstaddr` field of addresses on
IFF_LOOPBACK ifps is set to the same value that `ifa_addr`.  That's
why filtering for broadcast addresses is so complicated, because
guess what, `ifa_broadaddr` is the same as `ifa_dstaddr`!

Sadly our IPv6 code was "only" checking for `ifa_dstaddr` without
looking if the ifa was attached to a IFF_POINTOTPOINT interface.
So it always tried to create two routes to "::1" and, with the
recent RTF_LOCAL work, succeed.

You should now have only one local route to "::1".

Because of this semicolon, a local route was *always* created.  This
should have no impact except for IPv6 addresses on loopback interfaces
for which the IPv6 code was trying to create a route to "::1" twice.

This should now be fixed so we can fix the bug that was hidding a bug
who was hidding a bug... lalala...

	sys/arch/sgi/sgi: mutex.c 

Log message:
rework sgi mutexes to use the owner pointer as the lock.

this is like src/sys/arch/alpha/alpha/mutex.c r1.14.

this changes sgi mutexes so they record which cpu owns the lock
rather than just if the lock is held or not. the diagnostics compare
the owner to the current cpus curcpu() address so they can actually
tell if the current cpu holds the lock instead of whether any cpu
holds the lock.

instead of using custom asm to implement a cas this uses atomic_cas_ptr.

while im here i also shuffled the code. on MULTIPROCESSOR systems
instead of duplicating code between mtx_enter and mtx_enter_try,
mtx_enter simply loops on mtx_enter_try until it succeeds.

this also provides an alternative implementation of mutexes on
!MULTIPROCESSOR systems that avoids interlocking opcodes. mutexes
wont contend on UP boxes, theyre basically wrappers around spls.
we can just do the splraise, stash the owner as a guard value for
DIAGNOSTIC and return. similarly, mtx_enter_try on UP will never
fail, so we can just call mtx_enter and return 1.

Log message:
Back in January, Kaspars at Bankovskis dot net reported that the wc(1)
manual claims that -m would count characters, while our version of the
command actually doesn't, lacking POSIX multibyte support.  Since
nobody stood up to fix the code, sync the docs with reality for now.

	sys/net        : if.c if_var.h pipex.c pipex_local.h 

Log message:
replace the use of struct ifqueue in pipex with mbuf_queues.

this has a slight semantic change. previously pipex would only
process up to 128 packets on the input and output queues at a time
and would reschedule the softint if there were any left. now it
mq_delists the current set of pending packets and only processes
them. if anything is added to the queues later they'll cause the
softint to run again.

this in turn lets us deprecate sysctl_ifq since nothing uses it
anymore. because niqueues are mostly wrappers around mbuf_queues,
we can provide sysctl_mq and just #define sysctl_niq to it.

Log message:
Unify mdoc_deroff() and man_deroff() into a common function deroff().
No functional change except that for mdoc(7), it now skips leading
escape sequences just like it already did for man(7).
Escape sequences rarely occur in mdoc(7) code and if they do,
skipping them is an improvement in this context.
Minus 30 lines of code.

    import ports/net/librenms, ok benoit@ -- still a bit of a WIP, but usable enough.
    
    LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
    which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and
    operating systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade,
    Foundry, HP and many more. LibreNMS is a community-based fork of
    Observium.
    
    LibreNMS is not intended to replace a Nagios-type up/down monitoring
    system, but rather to complement it with an easy to manage, intuitive
    representation of historical and current performance statistics,
    configuration visualisation and syslog capture.

Log message:
Sneak in more Qt5 tweaks:

* Replace gross hack named post-configure with a qmake_all target call
before building documentation. The downside is that rebuild part will
run in a single process mode; the upside is that qdoc, qhelpgenerator
and anyone else will work as intended, without need of explicit
Qt build modules tweaking.

* Move a few files to -examples. QCounter sensor plugin is commented out
as it doesn't get installed in case qmake is rerun (see above). It looks
like this file shouldn't be installed in the first place, but I'm not
sure, thus using @comment for now.

Documentation building will be disabled until the issue seen by naddy@ gets
fixed.

being used for NX capability this time. If you need > 4GB phys, use amd64.

Userland W^X was committed yesterday by kettenis@, and we will shortly
start reworking the kernel like we did for amd64 a few months back to get
kernel W^X.

This has been in snaps for a few days and tested by kettenis and myself
as well.

Modified files:
	sys/dev/usb    : upd.c 

Log message:
Since upd(4) currently supports a known but limited number of sensors,
parse the HID descriptor multiple times to find them.

This logic is necessary to later create a tree of sensors in order to
avoid lookups in the hot path for sensors that depend on the value of
others.

Log message:
update afl to 1.73b
OK jsg@ (MAINTAINER)

--------------
Version 1.73b:
--------------

- Fixed a pretty stupid bug in effector maps that could sometimes cause
AFL to fuzz slightly more than necessary; and in very rare circumstances,
could lead to SEGV if eff_map is aligned with page boundary and followed
by an unmapped page. Spotted by Jonathan Gray.

--------------
Version 1.72b:
--------------

- Fixed a glitch in non-x86 install, spotted by Tobias Ospelt.

- Added a minor safeguard to llvm_mode Makefile following a report from
Kai Zhao.

Log message:
Adjust ld semantics to make static PIE the default.  Forgotten by pascal@.

Original commit message:

Change gcc and ld semantics to make static PIE the default when invoking
'cc -static'.  To explicitly request the legacy behaviour, use -nopie.

For the few port affected by this, bumps will follow shortly.

Log message:
Rewrite of the target resolution internals to be simpler and more
consistent but with much less duplication, but keeping the same internal
API. Also adds more readable aliases for some of the special tokens used
in targets (eg "{start}" instead of "^"). Some behaviours may have
changed, for example prefix matches now happen before fnmatch.

	sys/kern       : kern_time.c 

Log message:
Protect the per-process itimerval structs with a mutex.  We update these
from hardclock() which runs without grabbing the kernel lock.  This means
that two threads could concurrently update the struct which could lead to
corruption of the value which in turn could stop the timer.  It could also
result in getitimer(2) returning a non-normalized value.

With help from guenther@.

Log message:
If default-terminal is set to "screen" or "screen-*", emulate screen's
historical (incorrect) behaviour for SGR 3 and send smso
(standout). Previously, we would send sitm (italics) if the terminal
outside had it and smso otherwise. This was acceptably until recently
because xterm's terminfo entry lacked sitm, so most users got smso.

People who want italics should set default-terminal to the forthcoming
"tmux" entry (and be prepared to deal with it being missing on older
hosts).

As a side-effect this changes default-terminal to be a server rather
than a session option.

Log message:
Replace the kludge for the \z escape sequence by an actual
implementation.  As a side effect, minus ten lines of code.

As another side effect, this also fixes the assertion failure that
used to be triggered by "\z\o'ab'c" at the beginning of an output
line, found by jsg@ with afl (test case 022/Apr27).

Log message:
If a block body gets broken, that's no good reason to extend the
scope of the end macro.  Instead, only keep the tail scope open if
the end macro macro calls an explicit macro and actually breaks
that.  This corrects syntax tree structure and fixes an assertion
found by jsg@ with afl (test case 098/Apr27).

Log message:
Instead of using a single flat array for all sensors, put all the

Children sensors should only be probbed if their parent is active.

Log message:
Link report descriptors to known sensors.

Since HID buffers always start by a reportID we can access the corresponding
report descriptor in O(1).  Having a list of sensors attached to each report
descriptor makes it easier to update all of them with only on I/O request.

Note that sensors are attached in depency order on every report list.

    File::KeePass gives access to KeePass version 1 (kdb) and version 2
    (kdbx) databases.
    
    The version 1 and version 2 databases are very different in
    construction, but the majority of information overlaps and many
    algorithms are similar. File::KeePass attempts to iron out as many of
    the differences.
    
    File::KeePass gives nearly raw data access. There are a few utility
    methods for manipulating groups and entries. More advanced manipulation
    can easily be layered on top by other modules.

Surprisingly, this didn't cause any misformatting in the test suite

really correct for all conceivable input, and it would be very hard
to verify.  At the very least, it cannot have worked for man(7).

Log message:
mdoc_valid_post() may indirectly call roff_node_unlink() which may
set ROFF_NEXT_CHILD, which is desirable for the final call to
mdoc_valid_post() - in case the target itself gets deleted, the
parse point may need this adjustment - but not for the intermediate
calls - if intermediate nodes get deleted, that mustn't clobber the
parse point.  So move setting ROFF_NEXT_SIBLING to the proper place
in rew_last().

This fixes the assertion failure in jsg@'s afl test case 108/Apr27.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/hppa/hppa: mutex.c 
	sys/arch/hppa/include: mutex.h 

Log message:
rework hppa mutexes.

this is largely based on src/sys/arch/alpha/alpha/mutex.c r1.14 and
src/sys/arch/sgi/sgi/mutex.c r1.15

always and explicitely record which cpu owns the lock (or NULL if
noone owns it). improve the mutex diagnostics/asserts so they operate
on the mtx_owner field rather than mtx_lock. previously the asserts
would assume the lock cpu owns the lock if any of them own the lock,
which blows up badly.

hppa hasnt got good atomic cpu opcodes, so this still relies on
ldcws to serialise access to the lock.

while im here i also shuffled the code. on MULTIPROCESSOR systems
instead of duplicating code between mtx_enter and mtx_enter_try,
mtx_enter simply loops on mtx_enter_try until it succeeds.

this also provides an alternative implementation of mutexes on
!MULTIPROCESSOR systems that avoids interlocking opcodes. mutexes
wont contend on UP boxes, theyre basically wrappers around spls.
we can just do the splraise, stash the owner as a guard value for
DIAGNOSTIC and return. similarly, mtx_enter_try on UP will never
fail, so we can just call mtx_enter and return 1.

Tweaks to sysutils/nut:

- Install libupsclient headers/pkgconfig files. landry@ asked about
these; they needed a --with-dev configure flag to get them installed...

- Get rid of the useless ${NUT_USER} and ${NUT_ID} SUBST_VARS which are
now getting in the way of new files in the PLIST.

- Move some files from /usr/local/share/ups to a more easily recognisable
/usr/local/share/nut.

    Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services
    inhibited and only occurs with consent.
    In addition, all our builds are reproducible, and modifications are auditable,
    setting the project ahead of other secure browser providers.

Log message:
Flag user specified routes with an AF_LINK gateway as RTF_LLINFO.

This makes ND6 and ARP layers happy since they both check for this flag,
but is was redundant to provide route(8)'s "-llinfo" option when adding
a l2 route.

RTF_LLINFO is clearly redundant for userland tools, so only allow the
kernel to set it.

Now that we have a_fflag in struct vop_poll_args we can handle
things like POLLOUT on a read-only fd more sensibly.  Previously,
any poll events could be used regardless of the actual file flags
of the descriptor.  The new fifo_poll() is effectively a pared down
soo_poll() with slightly different semantics to batter match FIFOs.

Log message:
put mpi's atomics back in, but with the return value of add (and therefore sub, inc, and dec) fixed.

the asm read the value from memory into a register, added to it,
and then tried to write it back. after succeeding it doesnt have
to add again before returning.

this splits sub, inc, and dec off from add. sub can use the subf
opcode, and inc and dec can use the addic opcode. explicitely
identify where the modified memory is so we can avoid using "memory"
as a clobber.

Modified files:
	sys/netinet    : tcp_subr.c 

Log message:
Include the timestamp TCP option in keep alive packets as well.

According to RFC 7323 "once TSopt has been successfully negotiated,
... [it] MUST be sent in every non-<RST> segment for the duration
of the connection."  Which means that keep alives which are just
ACK packets must include that too.

    The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
    and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
    (as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
    or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
    execute Tcl code in those interpreters.

Log message:
    Import p5-Tkx 1.09.
    
    The Tkx module provides yet another Tk interface for Perl.  Tk is a GUI
    toolkit tied to the Tcl language, and Tkx provides a bridge to Tcl that
    allows Tk based applications to be written in Perl.
    
    The main idea behind Tkx is that it is a very thin wrapper on top of
    Tcl, i.e. that what you get is exactly the behaviour you read about in
    the Tcl/Tk documentation with no surprises added by the Perl layer.
    
    For a gentle introduction please read the Tkx::Tutorial.
    
    The tkx-ed example needs the bwidget OpenBSD package.

Log message:
Add a new `don't read back' flag for variables, to prevent reading their value
after modifying them. Give this flag to `display.focus', since screen
switching is asynchronous, and reading back will return the screen we are
switching from if the switch has not completed yet.

Also, disallow -= and += syntax for display.focus, as it doesn't make any sense.

Changes by:	miod@cvs.openbsd.org	2015/05/08 13:17:21

Modified files:
	sys/dev/wscons : wsdisplay.c 

Log message:
When changing screen saver parameters with wsconsctl (or any other way to
perform ioctls), check the flags of the currently displayed screen in order
to decide whether the screen saver needs to be retriggered, rather than the
flags of the device we are issuing the ioctl on.

wsconsctl will always use ttyC0, while the X server may run on another
virtual screen (such as ttyC4), and the kernel screen saver would then be
reenabled behind the X server's back.

While there, apply this `should the screen burner get reenabled or disabled?'
logic at the end of every virtual screen switch. The screen burner will now
get reenabled when switching from X11 to a virtual text console, and disabled
when switching back to X.

Modified files:
	usr.bin/col    : col.1 col.c 

Log message:
For half and reverse line feeds, recognize SUSv2-style escape-digit
sequences in the input stream in addition to traditional BSD-style
escape-control-char sequences because traditional tools, for example
Heirloom roff, produce SUSv2-style sequences.  Switch the encoding
of forward half line feeds in the output of -f back to SUSv2 style
because that's likely to work with more tools than the non-standard
traditional BSD-style sequence.  Fully document these choices.

Issues originally reported by bapt at FreeBSD.
OK millert@ jmc@, and bapt@ also more or less agrees with the direction.

Log message:
My commit adding RTL8188EU did introduce a regression after all.
Repair firmware reset on RTL8188CUS devices (and perhaps others) by
restoring the proper register write order in the non-8188EU code path.
Fixes "urtwn0: timeout waiting for firmware readiness" after device reset.

Log message:
VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS is the end of the kva range not the end of
addressable virtual memory space but arm ports were using a value of
0xffffffff for this.

Instead of using a shared VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS define add md
VM_KERNEL_SPACE_SIZE defines based on the KERNEL_VM_SIZE values
from the respective machdep.c files.

djm's novena was hitting "panic: bufinit: can't reserve VM for buffers"
without a similiar change.

Since we use the poll backend for select(2), care must be taken not

POLLNOHUP, is used by selscan() to tell the poll backend not to
return POLLHUP on EOF.  This is currently only used by fifo_poll().

	multimedia/x264/patches: patch-Makefile patch-configure 

Log message:
Drop local changes that build the static library without -fPIC.  These days
most of our architectures default to PIE, which for all practical purpose
is equivalent to PIC.  This also brings back -Bsymbolic, which is needed
on amd64 to work around the fact that some of the assembler code generates
R_X86_64_PC32 relocations that binutils 2.17 complains about (rightly so).

Set REVISION to reflect that this actually changes the generated binaries.

Log message:
Don't throw away output of {,un}register.sh (used in @exec and @unexec).
In theory, those should never fail, but espie@ frequently noticed failure
of register.sh (with a broken / incomplete ghc package db resulting in
hs libraries like Prelude or Distribution/Simple not found).

No bump yet, because it only adds spam during pkg_add.

Log message:
Make sure the amd64 assembly code calls libc functions through the PLT such
that it can be used to bake PIE.  The binutils 2.15 linker (incorrectly)
allows direct calls, but binutils 2.17 flags this as an error.

Modified files:
	gnu/usr.bin/binutils-2.17/bfd: elflink.c 

Log message:
Revert rev 1.3.  While that change appears to make the behaviour similar to
binutils 2.15, it introduces bogus failures when inter-library dependencies
are present.

With the binutils 2.17 behaviour restored, --as-needed will cause linker
failures when necessary inter-library dependencies are not present.  This is
actually a good thing as binutils 2.15 will silently produce executables
that will fail at runtime in those cases.

Modified files:
	sys/arch/armv7/imx: imxenet.c 

Log message:
Having the same settings on the same phy across multiple boards is just
asking too much in the arm world.

Translate the fec parameters from the novena dtb to set a different clock
skew to the same micrel phy used on sabre lite.  The novena dtb sets
txd[0-3]-skew-ps to 3000, the sabre lite sets them to 0.  When run through
the shifting/oring process from the micrel phy driver in FreeBSD this ends
up being a write of 0xffff on the novena and 0x0000 on sabre lite when
writing to TX_DATA_PAD_SKEW.

This change resolves the stability problems djm was seeing with imxenet
on novena.

Log message:
fix the kde3 vs kde4 bug.

frequent occurrences of tag mismatches were probably triggered by
the import of qt5, which is a long-running nojunk port.

when we're finished with kdeN ports, there's pressure to force junking to
go thru kdeM ports, BUT actual junking *won't* happen in the presence of
a nojunk port, though the current code make it seem as though
we've "succeeded".

Forensics shows:
23826@1431149112: K: x11/kde4/webdev openbsd-2 kde3 vs kde4
23826@1431149112: J: devel/hs-FindBin openbsd-2
23826@1431149119: B: security/p5-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA
23826@1431149120: J: x11/tellico-kde4 openbsd-2

which made no sense since nothing happened between the K and the J.

But the log of tellico shows the junk not happening.

Still tainted: 1
>>> Running junk in x11/tellico-kde4 at 1431149274
Can't run junk because of lock on x11/qt5,,-main

So synch "can_be_unjunked" for forced junks: it should not succeed if there's
a nojunk port.

Log message:
Allow multiple connected/interface routes to exist at the same time.
Use the existing multipath code. Switch away from using the ifa address
when making the cloning route and instead put a dummy sockaddr_dl route
in. With this it is possible to use the same network on multiple interfaces
at the same time. So if wireless and ethernet share the same network
the system will use the wired connection as long as there is link.
Still missing is builtin proxy-arp for the other interface IPs to allow
hitless failover.

based on the existing mechanism of "server".  "constraint" previously
only tried to connect to the first returned address, aborted and
skipped the constraint on failure.  In difference to "constraints"
(plural), it still only connects to one address at a time and not to
all of them at once.

Log message:
Add test cases for a crash reported by Bertrand PROVOST.  When a
HTTP client writes multiple requests or chunks in a single transfer,
relayd invokes the libevent callback manually for the next data.
If the callback closes the session, this results in an use after
free.
Test an invalid second request method, test an invalid header line
in the second PUT request, test an invalid second chunked length
for a PUT request.  Also test multiple valid HTTP 1.1 PUT requests
with chunked body.
To detect crashes of relayd, start it with "prefork 1" and grep for
"lost child" log messages.  Unfortunately only the first child is
monitored by the parent.

Log message:
Move the rdomain from struct ifnet into struct if_data.  This way it
will be exported to userland with the existing sysctl, getifaddrs()
and routing socket (if_msghdr.ifm_data) interfaces that expose
if_data.  All programs and daemons - Apps - that call the
SIOCGIFRDOMAIN ioctl in a getifaddrs() loop or after receiving an
interface message on the routing socket can now remove the pointless
additional ioctl.  In base, that could be: dhclient, isakmpd, dhcpd,
dhcrelay, ntpd, ospfd, ripd, ifconfig.

No ABI breakage because it uses a previously unused pad field in if_data.

dark net, nothing changes.

this is being enabled by default to allow gathering of more operational
information from users.  and if the operational heuristics in ntpd can be
suitable refined, this may stay the default into the future.  if not, ntpd
will become even more awesome along the way.

	usr.sbin/ntpd  : constraint.c 

Log message:
Currently, after 4 failed constraint checks, we suspect the constraint
of being wrong, not the NTP responses, reset it and query it from all
the constraint servers all over again.  This is turned out to be a bit
aggressive because it could get triggered with just a few bad NTP
peers in a larger pool.  To avoid constant reconnections, scale the
error margin with the number of resolved NTP peers using peer_cnt * 4.
This way a single or a few outliers in a NTP pool cannot trigger
reconnecting to the constraint servers immediately.  More NTP peers,
less reason to mistrust the constraint.

Log message:
Change spamd to use divert-to instead of rdr-to.

divert-to has many advantages over rdr-to for proxies.  For example,
it is much easier to use, requires less code, does not depend on
/dev/pf, works in-band without the asynchronous lookup (DIOCNATLOOK
ioctl), saves us from additional port allocations by the rdr/NAT code,
and even avoids potential collisions and race conditions that could
theoretically happen with the lookup.

Heads up: users will have to update their spamd PF rules from rdr-to
to divert-to.  spamd now also listens to 127.0.0.1 instead of "any"
(0.0.0.0) by default which should be fine with most setups but has to
be considered for some special configurations.

Log message:
Fix a crash reported and analyzed by Bertrand PROVOST.  When a HTTP
client or server writes multiple requests or chunks in a single
transfer, relayd invokes the libevent callback manually for the
next data.  If the callback closes the session, this resulted in
an use after free.
Instead of the more complicated fix suggested by Bertrand PROVOST,
just move the invocation of the callback to the end of the function.
So in case the callback frees any structures, they are not accessed.

Modified files:
	sys/kern       : kern_sysctl.c 

Log message:
For each file in sysctl(KERN_FILE_BYFILE), FILLIT() calls fill_file(),
which calls VOP_GETATTR().  For NFS, that leads to nfs_getattr().
If the node's attributes are not in NFS's cache, nfs_getattr() will
invoke nfs_request() and the latter will sleep, allowing the file
pointer to disappear while we traverse the list.
This results in kernel crashes while running netstat or pstat -f.
Grab a reference to the file descriptor before calling FILLIT(),
and release it afterwards.  This way the file descriptor cannot
disappear while we sleep in nfs_getattr().

"ASI" (address space identifier) appearing after an address, before
a comma.

- Adds the various-width load, store, and swap in alternate address
space instructions. (ldsba, ldsha, lduba, lduha, lda, stba, stha,
sta, swapa)

r237582

Log message:
Extend the libsa loadfile(9) granularity to tell apart randomness from the rest

of the randomness area.

This doesn't introduce any change for bootblocks (save for a slightly larger
stack usage due to the larger array), for the new {LOAD,COUNT}_RANDOM bits
are included in the {LOAD,COUNT}_ALL masks everything uses or computes from.

Only attempt to load /etc/random.seed from the boot device after the kernel
image has been succesfully loaded (with the recent loadfile changes allowing
us to know where the randomness needs to be loaded). While there, don't
bother doing this when booting from tape.

This works around the sun4e PROM 1.6, which gets confused by PROM open() -
close() sequences without any I/O happening in between.

Log message:
Keep track of the ifih corresponding to a vlan instance to ease its
removal.

As soon as carp(4) will be converted to the new if_input() API it
will be possible to add multiple vlan(4) and carp(4) pseudo-ifps on
top of the same parent interface.  When such thing happens we can no
longer assume that the first pseudo-ifp to be destroyed will be the
last configured.

Modified files:
	sys/netinet    : ip_carp.c 

Log message:
Correctly state the link state to INVALID when creating a carp interface.

Since vhe are allocated with M_ZERO and INIT is also defined to be 0,
carp_set_state() would result in a no-op because of the state check.

So explicitly initialize the state of a vhe to INIT and move the state
check in carp_set_state_all() to prevent similar issues in the future.

Problem and initial diff from Johan Ymerson, thanks!

Log message:

Log message:
Establish interrupts for both keyboard and mouse slots at pckbc attach time,
rather than lazily from pckbc when slots are discovered. This is consistent
with what other isa devices (and pckbc on non-isa busses) do, and as a side
effect, this makes the dmesg output shorter.

This will also let us get rid of pckbc's intr_establish() callback in a
later diff.

Prompted by krw@ noticing ugly kernel output in a configuration with the
mouse slot left empty. ok krw@ mpi@

remove ruby-jekyll, the version we have is so outdated it doesn't play nice
with the rest of the gems we have in tree. but more importantly, there's been
no interest in updating this port since 2 years. updated versions rely on
inotify which isn't going to fly.

Modified files:
	sys/netinet    : if_ether.c 

Log message:
Do not create ARP entries for RTF_BROADCAST routes.

This has been done because historically routes to broadcast addresses
were cloned like any ARP entry.  But for obvious reasons, no matching
Ethernet address could ever be resolved.  That's why we played tricks
with the expire timer.

Now that a RTF_BROADCAST route is created per configured IPv4 address,
we need to differenciate duplicated one.  And by not creating an ARP
entry we are allowed to write the IP address in the rt_gateway field,
which prevents MPATH conflicts.

This change is part of a fix to unbreak aliases since the kernel support
multiple connected routes for a subnet.

Log message:
Store the IP address of the corresponding ifa in the rt_gateway field
of RTF_CLONING and RTF_BROASCAST routes to not create MPATH conflicts
when IP address aliases are used.

This change makes it possible to have multiple RTF_CLONING routes with
the same priority.  Note that any of the existing RTF_CLONING route
might be used by the kernel to create a RTF_CLONED route which should
not be a problem with aliases since they are attached to the same ifp.

This unbreak address aliases since the kernel supports multiple connected
routes for a subnet.

Log message:
Don't create ICMP states on reply packets unless tracking states sloppy

Since we've strengthened the ICMP state matching procedure during lookup
to only match packets against states set up in a particular direction, we
need to make sure we don't create states on packets that would otherwise
be flowing in the direction opposite to the direction of the state and
prevent further packets from matching the created state due to strict
rules imposed by the ICMP direction check.

Update to ebook-tools-0.2.2

While at it:

* Drop documentation, which is mostly useless.  Only headers are actually
documented, and these are more accessible without doxygen-generated HTML.
* Remove USE_NINJA stuff - devel/cmake module handles that.
* Add HOMEPAGE.  There isn't much useful information on SourceForge project
page, but it is at least a pointer.
* Rewrite pkg/DESCR for more precision, and mentioned that lit2epub script,
which is installed with this port, requires clit package.

Log message:
texlive_base: Remove bogus symlink.

Although latexmk is included in texlive, we omit it in favour of our
separate port. texlive_base should not install a symlink.

There was also confusion between latex-mk and latexmk. We have both in
ports, but the latter is the one related to texlive. Let's mark is as a soft
dependency.

Upgrade path is currently leaving a partial package behind due to the bogus
symlink. A quirk will probably be required, which we can commit later.

Log message:
Define HAVE_AS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS and HAVE_AS_JSRDIRECT_RELOCS. These symbols are
only used by the alpha backend and allow it to produce more precise
relocation information, but need a recent as(1) for this to work.

This will be necessary to enable secureplt by default.

Modified files:
	lib/libc/arch/alpha/gen: divrem.m4 

Log message:
Since the __{div,rem}{l,q}{,u} special libc entry points use a specific
calling convention which conflicts over t11 usage with the secureplt
calling convention, force these symbols to be `notype' rather `function', so
that the linker will not attempt to use plt relocations for them in the
absence of explicit relocation information.

Note that these symbols are still public and still callable with the old plt
convention, so existing binaries will still work with an updated libc, and
no libc version change is necessary.

    cookies, query string generation and manipulation, and processing
    and preparing HTTP headers.
    
    CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also
    comes with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as
    FastCGI.
    
    It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years
    with input from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands
    of websites. CGI.pm was included in the perl distribution from perl
    v5.4 to v5.20, however is has now been removed from the perl core...

Modified files:
	sys/net        : if_ppp.c if_pppvar.h ppp_tty.c 

Log message:
there's been a long standing issue in ppp on a tty/serial line where it allocates mbufs at IPL_SOFTTTY, which is above the IPL_NET the mbuf layer protects itself at.

recent improvements to diagnostics in pools and mbufs now panic
instead of letting these things silently corrupt.

this reworks the ppp handling in the tty layer so it has its own
private pool to allocate packet memory out of. these packets get
built and then queued for softnet to process. softnet dequeues the
packet and attaches it to mbufs as external storage before handing
it on to the rest of the stack.

this was reported on bugs@ and tested by both Walter Daugherity and
Martin van den Nieuwelaar

mark the source pane and then change to the target pane to run swapp or

Log message:
New rtwn(4) driver for RTL8188CE wifi cards.

This is a PCI card from the same chip family as supported by urtwn(4) on USB.
Development started in 2013 using urtwn(4) as a starting point but was dormant
for much of the time since. I finally unslacked after uwe@ provided help with
lifting this driver on its feet. As usual we got helpful hints from Theo.

Requires firmware which will be available in ports soon.

There are rate adaptation issues that still need to be fixed, cause unknown.
In my testing the hardware rarely transmits more than 1Mbit/s.

Committing over MAC/BB RTL8188CE, RF 6052 1T1R.

Log message:
Remove unneeded splvm() calls and the pool_setipl(9) hack of r1.140.

By instructing spl(9) calls on MP machines I figured out that their high
cost was hiding a race condition involving PTE reuse in our pmap.  Thanks
to deraadt@ for finding a way to trigger such panic by adding a couple of
splvm().

This should make the races easier to trigger but will be addressed
shortly.

This commit starts your PowerPC pmap SMP show of the week.

Log message:
Do only one VP lookup when removing a page.

This simplify pmap_remove() & friends by re-using an already fetched PTE
descriptor.

There's currently a race on MP system where one CPU can reuse a pted
while another one is still trying to insert it in the HASH.  This commit
starts reducing the number of pmap_vp_lookup() calls to help fix this
race.

Log message:
More usages of pmap_ptedinhash().

If you wonder why pte_insert{32,64}() is not using pmap_hash_remove() if
it finds a conflicting PTE in the HASH, it's because in the current state
trying to grab the same lock a second time would lead to a deadlock.

This is much easier to reproduce on G5 (or G4 with BAT disabled).

Since this lock is recursive we can now guarantee the atomicity of

Log message:
Finally protect VP lookups to guarantee that a pted won't be freed or
reused by a CPU while another CPU is manipulating it.

This races occurs because the virtual spill handlers are run without
taking the KERNEL_LOCK for obvious reasons.  So use a per-pmap mutex
that CPUs must hold when modifying a pted in order to guarantee the
atomicity of operations *and* the coherence between pmap VPs tree and
what's in the HASH.

Thanks to dlg@ for assisting me debugging this.  This change ends your
PowerPC pmap SMP show of the week.  GENERIC.MP on macppc should now be
stable enough to build ports without corrupting its own memory.

Log message:
Do not unconditionally clear pcb_onfault after a uvm_fault.  That will
permit the active copyout/copyin to continue work on subsequent faulting
pages and not misinterpret & fault them as kernel bcopy against userland
addresses.  Old bug -- fall of 1996.  This should fix getentropy issues
on MP systems which have become more apparent recently, probably due to
some combo of increased ASLR with unlocked getentropy happening very soon
after vfork/fork...

Log message:
Instead of putting dead clients on a list and checking it every loop,
use event_once to queue a callback to deal with them. Also dead clients
with references would never actually be freed because the wrap-up
functions (the callback for stdin, or status_prompt_clear) would never
be called. So call them in server_client_lost.

Log message:
The text "indicates chip requires a non-free firmware which can not be
included with OpenBSD" is a marker which helps noone, in fact probably
hurts some people due to lack of detail or direction.  This is overFAQ'in
a non-issue which is actually not at all FAQ.

The markers do not allow people choose alternative product, since driver
abg on a chip from vendor XYZ does not come in a box labelled like that.
Secondly, the actual user experience is that post-install, they generally
do find that the chip works just fine, either because fw_update runs for
them or they find out soon that they need it.  Once again, this one liner
is not going to help people.  This particular FAQ entry, LOCATED RIGHT
HERE, does not help people who run into trouble.

Delete it all.

install'' with GOPATH set to ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}, runs its
output through sed to prevent writes outside WRKDIR sandbox
and sends output to sh(1).  During do-install it copies
executables from ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/bin to ${PREFIX}/bin,
and/or directories ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/pkg and
${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/src to ${PREFIX}/go, depending on
MODGO_TYPE contents.

Sets BUILD_DEPENDS, RUN_DEPENDS, ALL_TARGET, TEST_TARGET,
ONLY_FOR_ARCHS, SEPARATE_BUILD, and WRKSRC.

Defines:

MODGO_TYPE       Type of port.  May be any combination of:

bin  ordinary binary, which should be
installed to ${PREFIX}/bin,

lib  library, which should come with
source code.

Defaults to bin.

MODGO_WORKSPACE  Path to Go workspace set up for port build
process.  Defaults to ${WRKDIR}/go.  See
Go documentation for details.

MODGO_SUBDIR     Path to Go source code within port's
sources tarball.  Defaults to ${WRKDIST}.

MODGO_SETUP_WORKSPACE
Commands setting up Go workspace for
building ports.  By default, happens
during execution of post-patch target.

MODGO_BUILDDEP   Controls whether contents of
MODGO_BUILD_DEPENDS are appended to port's
BUILD_DEPENDS.  Defaults to Yes.

Additionally defines MODGO_PACKAGES, MODGO_SOURCES and
MODGO_TOOLS (paths for installed Go packages, sources and
tools respectively), MODGO_CMD and MODGO_FLAGS (source code
build command and flags passed as its arguments),
MODGO_BUILD_CMD and MODGO_TEST_CMD (commands for building
and testing go packages; normally called with canonical Go
package names as arguments),
MODGO_{BUILD,INSTALL,TEST}_TARGET and
MODGO_{BUILD,RUN}_DEPENDS.

- we do rescan paths anyway, so make sure we queue only path.
- forgetting distfile details does not get around caching, so do creation

we can still forget details.
To do: remove distfiles from queue during forget, because there's no longer

Modified files:
	lib/libssl/src/ssl: bs_ber.c bs_cbs.c bytestring.h 

Log message:
Make CBS_get_any_asn1_element() more compliant with DER encoding.

CBS_get_any_asn1_element violates DER encoding by allowing indefinite
form.  All callers except bs_ber.c expect DER encoding.  The callers
must check to see if it was indefinite or not.

Rather than exposing all callers to this behavior,
cbs_get_any_asn1_element_internal() allows specifying whether you want to
allow the normally forbidden indefinite form.  This is used by
CBS_get_any_asn1_element() for strict DER encoding and by a new static
function in bs_ber.c for the relaxed version.

While I was here, I added comments to differentiate between ASN.1
restrictions and CBS limitations.

will allow some code simplifications in HC drivers.

Since short-transfers were never checked for isoch transfers, we now need to
pass the USBD_SHORT_XFER_OK flag to not change this behavior.  This might be
revisited later.

Bring back r1.78 and r1.79, now that ajactouto@'s regression has

When a bus is explored, do not probe the ports which status hasn't
changed.  This saves a lot of I/O when attaching/detaching devices
and might help with some timing related problems.

Modified files:
	usr.bin/ssh    : auth2-pubkey.c 

Log message:
If AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand is specified, however
AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is not (or is set to "none"), authentication will
potentially fail due to key_cert_check_authority() failing to locate a
principal that matches the username, even though an authorized principal
has already been matched in the output of the subprocess. Fix this by using
the same logic to determine if pw->pw_name should be passed, as is used to
determine if a authorized principal must be matched earlier on.

Log message:
Store a unique ID, an interface index, rather than a pointer to the
receiving interface in the packet header of every mbuf.

The interface pointer should now be retrieved when necessary with
if_get().  If a NULL pointer is returned by if_get(), the interface
has probably been destroy/removed and the mbuf should be freed.

Such mechanism will simplify garbage collection of mbufs and limit
problems with dangling ifp pointers.

Tested by jmatthew@ and krw@, discussed with many.

SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA
SSL_OP_MICROSOFT_SESS_ID_BUG
SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_CHALLENGE_BUG
SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG

Modified files:
	lib/libtls     : tls.h 

Log message:
Add standard headers, C++ support to tls.h.

This makes using libtls easier to include by including dependent headers,
making something like this work as expected:

#include <iostream>
#include <tls.h>

int main()
{
std::cout << "tls_init: " << tls_init() << "\n";
}

This also makes building a standalone libtls-portable simpler.

Log message:
    New port: devel/go-check-v1
    
    gocheck works as an extension to the testing package and to the "go test"
    runner. That allows keeping all current tests and using gocheck-based tests
    right away for new tests without conflicts. The gocheck API was purposefully
    made similar to the testing package for a smooth migration.
    
    gocheck includes features such as:
    
    * helpful error reporting to aid on figuring problems out
    * richer test helpers: assertions which interrupt the test immediately, deep
    multi-type comparisons, string matching, etc
    * suite-based grouping of tests
    * fixtures: per suite and/or per test set up and tear down
    * benchmarks integrated in the suite logic (with fixtures, etc)
    * management of temporary directories
    * panic-catching logic, with proper error reporting
    * proper counting of successes, failures, panics, missed tests, skips, etc
    * explicit test skipping
    * support for expected failures
    * verbosity flag which disables output caching
    * multi-line string reporting for more comprehensible failures
    * inclusion of comments surrounding checks on failure reports

Log message:
Add a fix from Sergey Ryazanov <ryazanov.s.a / gmail.com> to handle
fragmented ppp frames while reading from pty. From Sergey's mail:

=====
xl2tpd could not correctly handle fragmented ppp frame while read it
from pty if one of consequent read operation return an error.
That's happening because xl2tpd too often cleans the buffer and
assumes that each read frame operation is performed for new frame,
since xl2tpd uses single buffer for pty and for socket read operations.

The attached patch moves all pty related buffers into _call_ context
and corrects calculation of buffer position, what fixes issue with
handling of fragmented frames. Now we can use MTU > 1000. I tested
these changes with load (L2TP tunnel without IPSec) and all seems work
normally. No more "Protocol-Reject" frames.
=====

Performance is still poor (Sergey was seeing ~2Mb/s, I am seeing less
despite low cpu use) but the tunnel now seems reliable.

os: Don't listen to 'tcp' by default. Add '-listen' option. [v2]

This disables the tcp listen socket by default. Then, it
uses a new xtrans interface, TRANS(Listen), to provide a command line
option to re-enable those if desired.

v2: Leave unix socket enabled by default. Add configure options.

    Parse::Yapp (Yet Another Perl Parser compiler) is a collection of
    modules that let you generate and use yacc like thread safe (reentrant)
    parsers with perl object oriented interface.
    
    The script yapp is a front-end to the Parse::Yapp module and lets you

	sys/uvm        : uvm_pmemrange.c 

Log message:
Fix a bug that causes uvm_pmr_get1page() to fail for allocations that
specify an address constraint even when free pages that meet the constraint
are still available.  This happens because the old code was using the root
of the size tree as a starting point for a search down the address tree.
This meant only part of the address tree was searched, and that part could
very well not contain any of the pages that met the constraint.  Instead,
always walk the address tree from its root if the list of single pages is
empty and the root of the size tree doesn't meet our constraints.

Make xhci(4)'s root hub report the same status bits as physical USB3 hubs.

There's not bit to indicate the speed of a USB3.0 device attached to a hub
port so do not abuse the PORT_TEST bit.  Instead make the xhci(4) root hub
report the PORT_POWER_SS bit when appropriate and use it to determin the
speed of a new device.

While here make the root hub report the link state and config error, from
FreeBSD.

we know that gnu ed and freebsd do reinstate the user defined prompt, but
we do not. no one has yet stepped up to change this, so i'm adding a note
to this effect until such a time as we do/

	regress/lib/libssl/bytestring: bytestringtest.c 

Log message:
Convert bytestringtest to individual checks and don't short circuit.

The statements were chained together with OR which makes it more annoying
to debug.  Also, it was short circuiting all tests as soon as one function
failed.  Since the functions are independent, they should each run until
error.

Discussed with miod@ and jsing@

Log message:
update to py-cryptography 0.91, and patch to permit building with recent
libressl (py-cryptography was providing its own implementation of
EC_curve_nid2nist for libressl and for old openssl versions, this was
broken when libressl added it - since LIBRESSL_VERSION doesn't provide
anything useful for recognising this, simply delete the libressl check
from the ifdef).

Not all drivers make use of ether_output() and there's no real reason to

sure only one copy per bridge go through bridge_output().

Log message:
update to unifi-4.6.3

Upstream has changed from providing a .war file to providing an unpackaged
webroot instead, so this won't upgrade cleanly. First pkg_delete unifi,
then rm -rf /usr/local/share/unifi/webapps/ROOT, then install. We can't
provide built packages of this port anyway, so this is relatively low
impact.

Tweaks and Feedback:
jca@ yasuoka@ jasper@ brad@ and Markus Lude, thanks !

tested by yasuoka@ and Markus Lude on @sparc64(markus's tests against 3.18 version, but no many changes to 3.19, assuming that should work too...)...

Log message:
Cards with revision < 10 (qemu rev is 0), have no ad1848 chip and
don't attach the ad1848 driver. But the "malloc" method of gus_hw_if
is ad1848_malloc() which assumes a ad1848 is attached (and expect the
softc pointer to be a struct ad1848_softc, but get a gus_softc pointer
instead). Implement, the missing gus_{malloc,free,mappage,...}
routines. Add the missing mtx_{enter,leave} calls, as we're at it.

    Import gdmap-0.8.1
    
    GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space. To display directory
    structures cushion treemaps are used which visualize a complete folder or even
    the whole hard drive with one picture.
    
    Cushion treemaps display directories and files in rectangular areas. The larger
    a file is the larger is the rectangle which represents it. All files in one
    directory are painted within the rectangle of that directory.

Log message:
Never cache a RTF_GATEWAY route as next hop for a gateway route.

This prevents rtentry loops when rt->rt_gwroute points to rt leading
to an infamous "rtentry leak" panic, easily triggered by dhclient(8)
trying to remove a route after resuming a machine.

This bug is at least 20 years old!  4.4BSD-Lite2 had a fix for it in
its X.25 output routine but apparently it never made it into OpenBSD.

Rework WANTLIB/DEPENDS.
By default we depend on py-gtk+2 except for the python3 FLAVOR where we depend
on py-gobject3 and gtk+3. We don't want to depend on all possible toolkits for
obvious reason, so people will have to manually install py-qt4 for example to
use the qt4 toolkit.

Log message:
    import facter-3.0.1
    
    Native implementation of facter functionality in C++11, providing:
    - a shared library which gather facts about the system
    - an executable for standalone command line usage
    - a ruby file to enable require 'facter'
    Facter is especially useful for retrieving things like operating system
    names, hardware characteristics, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH
    keys.
    
    Note that this port doesn't provide all the facts that sysutils/ruby-facter
    does right now, but that's being worked on. therefore it's not used by
    puppet yet.

the attacker can send a carefully-crafted packet to ntpd that will cause ntpd

Log message:
Link yakuake-kde4 to build.

There were some problems with building it a while ago, when KDE3 and KDE4
builds weren't separated well enough. No problems are there now, so there
is no reason to avoid building it either.

Tested on amd64. Note that yakuake could fail to show its window under cwm,
the issue is to be resolved. It works perfectly fine under KWin, though.

because PLIST of kdepim package relies on minor version of Grantlee.

srp allows concurrent access to a data structure by multiple cpus
while avoiding interlocking cpu opcodes. it manages its own reference
counts and the garbage collection of those data structure to avoid
use after frees.

internally srp is a twisted version of hazard pointers, which are
a relative of RCU.

jmatthew wrote the bulk of a hazard pointer implementation and
changed bpf to use it to allow mpsafe access to bpfilters. however,
at s2k15 we were trying to apply it to other data structures but
the memory overhead of every hazard pointer would have blown out
significantly in several uses cases. a bulk of our time at s2k15
was spent reworking hazard pointers into srp.

this diff adds the srp api and adds the necessary metadata to struct
cpuinfo on our MP architectures. srp on uniprocessor platforms has
alternate code that is optimised because it knows there'll be no
concurrent access to data by multiple cpus.

srp is made available to the system via param.h, so it should be
available everywhere in the kernel.

the docs likely need improvement cos im too close to the implementation.

pmap_enter(9), pmap_remove(9) and pmap_page_protect(9) safe to use without
holding the kernel lock.  Unfortunately there still seems to be an issue
that causes deadlocks under pressure.  That shouldn't be an issue as
long as uvm still calls the pmap functions with the kernel lock held.

Hopefully committed this will help finding the last bugs.

    SIMPLE-MTPFS (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system for
    Linux capable of operating on files on MTP devices attached via USB to the local
    machine. On the local computer where the SIMPLE-MTPFS is mounted, the
    implementation makes use of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).
    The practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact with
    MTP device files.

Fixes CVE-2015-4625, a local privilege escalation due to predictable

Zero for reporting this issue. For the future, authentication agents are
encouraged to use PolkitAgentSession instead of using the D-Bus agent response
API directly.

Fixes CVE-2015-3256, various memory corruption vulnerabilities in use of the
JavaScript interpreter, possibly leading to local privilege escalation.

Fixes CVE-2015-3255, a memory corruption vulnerability in handling duplicate
action IDs, possibly leading to local privilege escalation. Thanks to
Laurent Bigonville for reporting this issue.

Fixes CVE-2015-3218, which allowed any local user to crash polkitd. Thanks to

Log message:
    Import textproc/p5-Pod-Cpandoc 0.15
    
    "cpandoc" is a perl script that acts like "perldoc" except that if it
    would have bailed out with "No documentation found for
    "Uninstalled::Module"", it will instead scrape a CPAN index for the
    module's documentation.
    
    One important feature of "cpandoc" is that it *only* scrapes the live
    index if you do not have the module installed. So if you use "cpandoc"
    on a module you already have installed, then it will just read the
    already-installed documentation. This means that the version of the
    documentation matches up with the version of the code you have. As a
    fringe benefit, "cpandoc" will be fast for modules you've installed. :)

Major update to thunderbird 38.0.1/lightning 4.0.

- See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/38.0.1/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA 2015-59,63,66,67,70,71
- We keep lightning optional by moving it out of the distributions/ dir,
this way we ensure updates are done from the port (no xpi are provided
upstream for openbsd anyway, so updates wouldnt work)
- Switch i386 to build with clang
- Remove libvpx hack & patches
- Remove useless patches

Been using the betas since a while without major issue, this will ensure
it gets proper testing/dogfooding - since my call for testing on ports@
lead to .. not much feedback. Note that the first bugfix 38.1.0 release
is already around the corner.

Remove use of sudo from pkg READMEs in a few ports as packages and their

- replace some 'sudo -u user somecommand foo bar' with
'su -s /bin/sh user "/path/to/somecommand foo bar"' and similar.
Not pretty with the -s, but many of the uids that need to run
these commands have /sbin/nologin as their usual shell.

Log message:
Revert upstream commit 457492e97dd1435021cff15d4fbb8f1fd7be9b24, it breaks
due to changing "-I/usr/local/include/kde4" to
"-isystem /usr/local/include/kde4". Still investigating, who to blame:
CMake, Phonon or maybe someone else... not me, right?

(note for myself: there is no such thing as extra build for KDE stuff)

Breakage noticed by naddy@: thanks and sorry.

Modified files:
	sys/net        : radix.c 

Log message:
Do not return internal nodes to the upper layer in rn_lookup().

The limit between the radix layer and the route layer is somewhat
vague, if it exists at all.  This changes prevent rtrequest1(9) to
find and delete the root node (RNF_ROOT) when trying to delete a
non-existing default route:

# route delete 0.0.0.0
delete host 0.0.0.0
# route delete 0.0.0.0
route: writing to routing socket: No such process
delete host 0.0.0.0: not in table

Historically rn_delete() was a no-op when called with an internal
node as argument.  But there's no reason to manipulate such node.
In a better world rn_match() would contain such check, but let's
change the perfect-match function for the moment as this fixes a
bug and many dragons are lurking in there.

Fix a regression introduced by the big refactoring of r1.40 and
reported by tobias@.

Return correct file name entry from DWARF line table

We run the DWARF line table program to generate each row of the table
until we find a row after the one we wanted, and then take the
previous row's entries.  The code correctly took the previous row's
line number entry, but incorrectly took the current row's file name
entry.  Notably, this caused DDB to report the wrong file names for
inlined calls to functions defined in header files.

Log message:
Use a new RTF_CONNECTED flag for interface (connected) routes.

Recent changes to support multiple interface routes broke the
assumption made by all our userland routing daemons concerning
interface routes.  Historically such routes had a "gateway"
sockaddr of type AF_LINK.  But to be able to support multiple
interface routes as any other multipath routes, they now have
a unique "gateway" sockaddr containing their corresponding IP
address.

This self-describing flag should avoid ambiguity when dealing
with interface routes.

Log message:
Linking the local socket to pf states went wrong when IPsec was
involved.  For outgoing packets the IPsec layer did not clear the
sending socket from the mbuf when the address changed.  This resulted
in strange state match and create behavior in pf.  So clear the pf
statekey and inp in the packet header for both directions when the
address changes.

security update to openssl-1.0.1o (libressl is not affected by this problem)

During certificate verification, OpenSSL (starting from version 1.0.1n and
1.0.2b) will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first
attempt to build such a chain fails. An error in the implementation of this
logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted
certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid
leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.

This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including
SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.

Log message:
Don't call pool_put(9) while holding a mutex.  Instead collect pv entries in
a list and put them back into the pool after releasing the mutex.  This
prevents a lock ordering problem between the per-pmap mutexes and the kernel

to free a pool page.

This seems to make the i386 pmap mpsafe enough to run the reaper without
holding the kernel lock.

Added files:
	editors/emacs/patches: patch-src_unexelf_c 

Log message:
Fix SIGBUS at unexec() step on sparc64.

Most likely due to the switch to binutils-2.17, emacs crashes with SIGBUS
at the loadup build step on sparc64, because it puts the section headers
at an unaligned address.

I am not sure whether this is the True Proper Fix.  Also, other strict
architectures ought to be affected too.  But let's at least provide
a working emacs package for sparc64 users at c2k15.

To be revisited laterwith feedback from upstream.

Log message:
By default, require an exact match of the process name and argument list.
This allows running several instances of the same rc.d(8) script by just
linking it to different name.
e.g.
ln -s ftpproxy ftpproxy6
echo 'ftpproxy6_flags=-6' >>/etc/rc.conf.local

This is likely to break some rc.d scripts in ports. I will try and fix them all
in the next few days but I'd appreciate reports if I missed some.

While here, make serverconfig_free() a little more bulletproof by

Log message:
Do not allow TS_check_signer_name() with signer == NULL from
int_TS_RESP_verify_token(). Coverity CID 21710.

Looking further, int_TS_RESP_verify_token() will only initialize signer to
something non-NULL if TS_VFY_SIGNATURE is set in ctx->flags. But guess what?
TS_REQ_to_TS_VERIFY_CTX() in ts/ts_verify_ctx.c, which is the TS_VERIFY_CTX
constructor, explicitely clears this bit, with:
ret->flags = TS_VFY_ALL_IMPRINT & ~(TS_VFY_TSA_NAME | TS_VFY_SIGNATURE);

    Racket is a multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp/Scheme
    family, that also serves as a platform for language creation, design,
    and implementation.
    
    The primary components of Racket platform are:
    
    - The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
    various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
    - pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
    for user-contributed packages.
    - raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
    source to bytecode, packaging executables, packaging installable
    archives, and installing packages from remote servers.

	infrastructure/db: config.site 

Log message:
Add some common PIE tests to config.site to our cache in config.site;
this prevents some ports from adding their own flags to force PIE.
On arch where PIE is known to work on OpenBSD we are setting the compiler
to produce PIE object code by default so in those cases this is a noop,
and should fix a few ports where arch don't work with PIE yet (e.g. arm).

Modified files:
	lib/libssl/src/crypto/asn1: a_mbstr.c 

Log message:
Explicitely cast a char into unsigned long before shifting it left by 24, for
this would promote it to int for the shift, and then cast to unsigned long,
sign-extending it if sizeof(long) > sizeof(int).

This was not a problem because the computed value was explicitely range
checked afterwards, with an upper bound way smaller than 1U<<31, but it's
better practice to cast correctly.

Log message:
If we can read faster from disk than send data to the client stop
reading from disk when we hold a certain amount of data in

huge) in RAM.

Probably the issue has been fixed by now. And if not, the relevant scsi
controller drivers should add a workaround in their DVACT_POWERDOWN
hook.

While there, change the default final reset delay on amd64 to 0. People
who like looking at the final reboot message may still set the
CPURESET_DELAY define.

Log message:
Remove compat hack that disabled ECDHE-ECDSA on OS X.

For a few old releases, ECDHE-ECDSA was broken on OS X.  This option
cannot differentiate between working and broken OS X so it disabled
ECDHE-ECDSA support on all OS X >= 10.6.  10.8-10.8.3 were the faulty
releases but these are no longer relevant.  Tested on OS X 10.10 by jsing.

Log message:
Explicitly do EtherIP encapsulation in bridge_ifenqueue().

The way gif(4) and bridge(4) are plugged together is disgusting but at
least this makes the layer violation obvious.

Fix a regression introduced by the M_PROTO1 loop prevention cleaning
because gif(4) was abusing this flag to figure out if the packet was
coming from a bridge(4).

Thanks to goda@ for finding this!

done in this region using PAE w/NX caused #PFs (as they lacked the exec

Also unmap the region when we're finished. No sense in leaving extra
executable regions lying around.

Fixes non-ACPI uniprocessor i386 machines that have NX/PAE (these would
previously panic in pcibiosattach).

Log message:
Release the kernel lock while tearing down the uvm map in the reaper.  Speeds
up workloads that fork a lot of processes and, more importantly reduces
latency because it makes sure the reaper doesn't hold on to the kernel lock
for long periods of time.

This almost certainly breaks MP kernels on alpha, macppc, m88k and sgi;
hppa might work, but probably doesn't.

Log message:
Initial, still somewhat experimental implementation to leverage

definitions of various terms inside manual pages.
To be polished in the tree, so bear with me and report issues.

Technically, if less(1) is used as a pager, information is collected
by the mdoc(7) terminal formatter, first stored using the ohash
library, then ultimately written to a temporary file which is passed
to less via -T.  No change intended for other output formatters or
when running without a pager.

On systems with a full routing table (550k+), we often want to be able to
look at the routes with a priority, or to display all routes that do not
have a specific priority (normally, don't show bgp).

We are intentionally not updating netstat -r yet, as we do not have a
good flag to use.

    Import pudb, a console-based python debugger.  Input from and ok sthen@
    
    $ cat pkg/DESCR:
    PuDB is a console-based python debugger which features:
    
    - Syntax-highlighted source, the stack, breakpoints and variables are
    all visible at once and continuously updated. This helps you be more
    aware of what‚Äôs going on in your program. Variable displays can be
    expanded, collapsed and have various customization options.
    
    - Simple, keyboard-based navigation using single keystrokes makes
    debugging quick and easy. PuDB understands cursor-keys and Vi
    shortcuts for navigation. Other keys are inspired by the
    corresponding pdb commands.
    
    - Use search to find relevant source code, or use "m" to invoke
    the module browser that shows loaded modules, lets you load new ones
    and reload existing ones.
    
    - Breakpoints can be set just by pointing at a source line and
    hitting "b" and then edited visually in the breakpoints window. Or
    hit "t" to run to the line under the cursor.
    
    - Drop to a Python shell in the current environment by pressing
    "!".
    
    - PuDB places special emphasis on exception handling.
    
    - A post-mortem mode makes it easy to retrace a crashing program‚Äôs
    last steps.
    
    - IPython integration (see wiki[1])
    
    - Should work with Python 2.4 and newer, including Python 3.

Security fixes for qemu, from brad:

CVE-2015-3456  fdc: force the fifo access to be in bounds of the allocated buffer

During processing of certain commands such as FD_CMD_READ_ID and
FD_CMD_DRIVE_SPECIFICATION_COMMAND the fifo memory access could
get out of bounds leading to memory corruption with values coming
from the guest.

Fix this by making sure that the index is always bounded by the
allocated memory.

CVE-2015-3209  pcnet: force the buffer access to be in bounds during tx

4096 is the maximum length per TMD and it is also currently the size of
the relay buffer pcnet driver uses for sending the packet data to QEMU
for further processing. With packet spanning multiple TMDs it can
happen that the overall packet size will be bigger than sizeof(buffer),
which results in memory corruption.

Fix this by only allowing to queue maximum sizeof(buffer) bytes.

Modified files:
	lib/libtls     : tls.c 

Log message:
Set SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE and SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER
in libtls.  This gives tls_write() a similar short write semantics
as write(2).  So implementing daemons with libevent buffers will
be easier and workarounds in syslogd and httpd can be removed.

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/httpd : httpd.h server.c 

Log message:
libtls has been changed to set SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE and
SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER by default.  This gives
tls_write() a similar short write semantics as write(2) and a
workaround in httpd to cope with the previous differences can be
removed.  Specifically, httpd can stop copying data into a local
buffer that was used to keep it around for repeated writes.

the instructions correctly (except for p{ins,ext}rd which are not supported
yet by as(1) under OpenBSD, but will be fixed shortly).

Log message:
Add TLS_method, TLS_client_method and TLS_server_method.

Use these instead of SSLv23_*method when you want to make sure TLS is
used.

By default, we disable SSLv3 but it's still possible for the user to
re-enable it.  TLS_*method does not allow SSLv3.

Both BoringSSL and (next version of) OpenSSL have these methods.
However, they have changed the implementation significantly.  We will
as well, but not right now.

Log message:
Rework kroute.c to send only the best routes to lde.

This is major rework of the kroute.c code. The idea is remove complexity
from the lde process by making kroute.c advertise only the lowest priority
routes of each prefix.

kroute.c now keeps track of all routes using three different structures:
kroute_prefix, kroute_priority and kroute_node.

kroute_prefix represents a prefix and contains an ordered list of
priorities (kroute_priority) and for each priority there is a list of
nexthops (kroute_node). Arranging the routes using these three structures
allows for the writing of a simpler code, easier to understand.

Whenever a route is removed, if there's another route for the same prefix,
but with a lower priority, this route is immediately sent to lde.

Additional fixes:
* On RTM_CHANGE, remove the old route before installing the new one;
* On IMSG_CTL_KROUTE_ADDR, show all nexthops for multpath routes;

release after updating from disk for a while.

NOTE: This matches fw_update behaviour in that during a beta cycle,
it will expand to 5.8 (for e.g.) instead of snapshots.

Log message:
Remove incomplete support for unnecessary modes of  operation.

LDP has several modes of operation, it was designed in that way so it
could run on legacy equipment like ATM/FR switches with very strict
memory limitations.

For modern hardware there's no point on using either the "Conservative
Label Retention" or "Downstream On Demand" modes of operation since they
save memory at cost of blackholing traffic when routing changes. Major
vendors implement only the "Liberal Label Retention" and "Downstream
Unsolicited" modes for non ATM/FR hardware. Let's do that too.

As for using either "Independent Control" or "Ordered Control", let's
stick with the first option mainly because it's easier to implement
and because it doesn't really matter which control mode is used. For
reference, Cisco implements only "Independent Control" and Juniper only
"Ordered Control". Both modes are interoperable.

The point of supporting only one combination of all modes of operation
is that it will allow for the writing of a simpler code without removing
useful functionality.

Log message:
Rework label mapping algorithms to be more in line with the RFC.

This patch presents a thoroughly review of the label mapping
algorithms. Most of the changes are minor bug fixes in the handling of
received label messages.

Additional improvements:
* Add a few more references to the Appendix A of the RFC5036 ("LDP
Label Distribution Procedures") into the code;
* Add full multipath support;
* Send label withdraws when appropriate;
* Add label withdraw/release wildcard support.

NOTE: As a result of implementing only the "Liberal Label Retention" and
"Downstream Unsolicited" modes, we will never send a label request
("Request  Never"). And that means that we can ignore the following
notification messages: "Label Request Aborted", "No Label Resources",
"No Route" and "Label Resources Available". The following algorithms
mentioned in the RFC can also be ignored: "Timeout of Deferred Label
Request", "Detect Local Label Resources Have Become Available" and
"Receive Label Abort Request".

Now, considering that we only support one combination of all modes of
operation, we can say that we have an almost complete implementation of
the protocol.

	                       patch-gettext-tools_src_Makefile_in 

Log message:
Split gettext into a small runtime component and a separate large
set of development tools as recommended by upstream.

Ports will continue to depend on devel/gettext for libintl.  The
gettext module also provides an automatic build dependency on
devel/gettext-tools for msgfmt etc.

A few ports that require a library provided by gettext-tools get a
corresponding dependency.

Also update gettext to 0.19.5.1.

Log message:
rework how iobus(4) finds and attaches devices.

this allows us to get rid of the static list of children devices, using only
a lookup table for address hints where needed. as a bonus this removes the
'octcf0: [..] not configured' mesage on machines w/o octcf(4).

This follows the CFI specification with code borrowed from zrouter

be to move it to MI land.

The prerequisites to MI are width, shift and row detection and handling.
In the long run I hope to be able to also add wdc support.

For now write support is disabled.

The actual issue is that the #if/else logic is guarding the wrong

wrong because it was in the wrong location.

Log message:
Improve handling of addresses on ldpe.

This is a preliminary work for the the next patch (sigup config
reload). We want to make sure that the ldpe process can handle duplicated
addresses.

The idea is to alloc two different if_addr structures for each address,
and link one in the global list of addresses (used to send address
messages) and link the other to the associated interface list of
addresses.

Doing that we will be able to call kif_redistribute() after reloading
the config file and activate the new LDP enabled interfaces.

NOTE: Interfaces are created at config parse time and the child
processes inherit them on fork() so there's no need to send a status
update at startup.

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/ldpd  : lde.c lde.h lde_lib.c 

Log message:
Record all fields of the received label mappings.

Since we implement the Liberal Label Retention mode, we need to record
all fields of the received label mappings so the messages can be processed
later when there is a matching nexthop for the advertised FECs.

This will be important when we implement VPLS because we need to retain
information like the pseudowire's interface MTU and Group ID.

Log message:
VPLS signaling support.

This patch introduces full support for pseudowire signaling in ldpd(8),
including Control Word and Status TLV negotiation.

As of now it's not possible to configure a VPWS, but the signaling is
the same. In the future, when VPWS support is available in the kernel,
ldpd(8) can be extended to support VPWS with only a few modifications.

Limitations:
* No support for FEC 129, only FEC 128 (more widely deployed);
* No support for group withdraws (not widely deployed);
* No support for MAC withdraws (not widely deployed).

Modified files:
	usr.sbin/ldpd  : ldpe.c ldpe.h neighbor.c 

Log message:
Fix some awful ipc synchronization issues.

Under some rare circumstances the following can happen:
1 - one neighbor sends a label withdraw followed by a fatal notification
message;
2 - ldpe parses the label withdraw and sends it to lde;
3 - ldpe parses the fatal notification message and closes the session;
4 - lde processes the label withdraw and asks ldpe to send a label release;
5 - at around the same time, ldpe restarts the session with the neighbor;
6 - ldpe processes the lde message and then sends a label release to the new
neighbor.

The problem is that we don't want a message enqueue to a neighbor to be sent
after the session is restarted. If a session is closed, all the enqueued
messages should be discarded.

To acomplish this, we update the peerid of the nbr structure everytime the
session is established.

Log message:
Remove p5-Net-TCLink: old, insecure *and* broken company-specific software.

Uses SSLv3 only, does no certificate checking, no update since 2003,
regress tests don't pass, etc.  The company behind it restricts access to
data needed to make this port work properly in the long run.

Discussed with Chris Bennett, who doesn't use this port anymore but tried
to discuss with upstream.  Thanks!

Modified files:
	sys/kern       : uipc_usrreq.c 

Log message:
For unix domain sequenced packet socket pairs the ruby regression
tests reported an EMSGSIZE error although the sent message was not
too large.  The way backpressure was implemented for unix domain
sockets confused the check in sosend().

Unix domain sockets append data only to the recv buffer.  To report
the amount of content to the sender, the high watermark of the send
buffer was reduced.  This happend for SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET.
Sosend checks wether atomic chunks could ever fit into the send
buffer which is limited by the high watermark.  This happens for
SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET.  For SOCK_SEQPACKET the combination
of these mechanisms resulted in an EMSGSIZE error when the buffer
got filled.  This also happened when space could be created by
reading from the other end in contradiction to the semantics of
EMSGSIZE.

Do not emulate a send buffer that has no space.  It is better to
fill the buffer with fake data than to reduce its size.  Thus the
high watermark always contains the real value.  When disconnecting,
reset the counters.  Otherwise the socket layer would try to flush
non existing data in the send buffer.

Tested by jeremy@ with a C program and the ruby tests.

Log message:
Remove the hack of scrolling forward and backward with +G1G that
many (jmc@, millert@, espie@, deraadt@) considered revolting.
Instead, when using a pager, since we are using a temporary file
for tags anyway, use another temporary file for the formatted
page(s), as suggested by millert@ and similar to what the traditional
BSD man(1) did, except that we use only one single temporary output
file rather than one for each formatted manual page, such that
searching (both with / and :t) works across all the displayed files.

Log message:
Rework buffer position reporting code.

- use simpler data structures (makes the code shorter).

- if multiple interrupts are missed, call audio(4) as many times as we
missed interrupts (unless the pointer wrapped, which this is
undetectable, but upper layer handles it)

- fetch the link fifos size in the interrupt handler, as, according to
the spec it may change dynamically.

- certain devices expose the last offset of the link fifo size instead
of the fifo size itself; workaround this by incrementing the
reported link fifo size if it's odd. Fixes recovery after missed
interrupts on asus eeepcs, maybe others.

17 years ago, setfault() was modified to save the status register in the

way it was saved was unsafe if interrupts were enabled, and could cause %r2
to be lost.

Discussing this with deraadt@ at the end of c2k15, this was probably needed
for the old VI boards which were the target of the original powerpc port,
came with a worse-than-Genesi openfirmware. Since then, machine check
exceptions have been unheard of; or, if they happen, they do not need the
status register to be restored.

Log message:
Unbreak boost on (at least) alpha, hppa and sparc64

- ensure we don't build the 'context' and 'coroutine' libs, they are not
portable and the latter depends on the former
- don't use the 'gcc_sparc' backend in Boost.atomic, for it doesn't
build; use the generic gcc backend based on __sync_*
- stop tweaking cc -march / -mcpu values; this is not desirable on any
arch and it breaks on sparc64 due to a bogus -mcpu=c3 default
- don't attempt to force -m32 / -m64 flags, this breaks at least alpha

Log message:
Fix i217 PHY initialization

Add a workaround for a hardware bug were receiving of packets would stop
until the battery of the laptop was removed. The problem could be
triggered if the LAN cable was plugged in after the PHY had already been
initialized.

The workaround is already present in FreeBSD (e1000_ich8lan.c:
e1000_lv_jumbo_workaround_ich8lan()) and Linux. The commit messages of
b20a7744 and da1e2046 in Linux have some more details.

Found and ported from FreeBSD by Valentin Dornauer.

Tested by many.

Log message:
Change the ssh root login question to avoid the unnatural keyword
"without-password". Instead use "pubkeys-only" which people will find
conceptually easier.  Still quietly accept "w" or "without-password"
as an option.
Place a warning beforehands:
WARNING: root is targetted by password guessing attacks, pubkeys are safer.

Everyone happy now, or at learning to not use root passwords?
