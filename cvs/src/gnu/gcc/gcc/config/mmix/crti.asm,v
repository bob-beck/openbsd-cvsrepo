% This is the crt0 equivalent for mmix-knuth-mmixware, for setting up
% things for compiler-generated assembly-code and for setting up things
% between where the simulator calls and main, and shutting things down on
% the way back.  There's an actual crt0.o elsewhere, but that's a dummy.

% This file and the GCC output are supposed to be *reasonably*
% mmixal-compatible to enable people to re-use output with Knuth's mmixal.
% However, forward references are used more freely: we are using the
% binutils tools.  Users of mmixal beware; you will sometimes have to
% re-order things or use temporary variables.

% Users of mmixal will want to set up 8H and 9H to be .text and .data
% respectively, so the compiler can switch between them pretending they're
% segments.

% This little treasure is here so the 32 lowest address bits of user data
% will not be zero.  Because of truncation, that would cause testcase
% gcc.c-torture/execute/980701-1.c to incorrectly fail.
