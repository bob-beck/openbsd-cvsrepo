   VLIW pack, so you used to be unable to set a breakpoint in the
   initial instruction of a function that followed such
   alignment-introduced instructions.

   We could have arranged to emit `nop' instructions (0x80880000),
   maybe even VLIW-pack sequences of nop instructions as much as
   possible for the selected machine type, just in case the alignment
   code actually happens to run, but this is probably too much effort

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
