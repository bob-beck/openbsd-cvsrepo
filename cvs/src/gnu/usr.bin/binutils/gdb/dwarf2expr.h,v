  /* An array of pieces.  PIECES points to its first element;
     NUM_PIECES is its length.

     Each time DW_OP_piece is executed, we add a new element to the
     end of this array, recording the current top of the stack, the
     current in_reg flag, and the size given as the operand to
     DW_OP_piece.  We then pop the top value from the stack, clear the
     in_reg flag, and resume evaluation.

     The Dwarf spec doesn't say whether DW_OP_piece pops the top value
     from the stack.  We do, ensuring that clients of this interface
     expecting to see a value left on the top of the stack (say, code
     evaluating frame base expressions or CFA's specified with
     DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression) will get an error if the expression
     actually marks all the values it computes as pieces.

     If an expression never uses DW_OP_piece, num_pieces will be zero.
     (It would be nice to present these cases as expressions yielding
     a single piece, with in_reg clear, so that callers need not
     distinguish between the no-DW_OP_piece and one-DW_OP_piece cases.
     But expressions with no DW_OP_piece operations have no value to
     place in a piece's 'size' field; the size comes from the
     surrounding data.  So the two cases need to be handled
     separately.)  */
