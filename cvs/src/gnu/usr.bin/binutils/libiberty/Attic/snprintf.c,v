@@deftypefn Supplemental int snprintf (char *@@var{buf}, size_t @@var{n}, const char *@@var{format}, ...)

This function is similar to sprintf, but it will print at most @@var{n}
characters.  On error the return value is -1, otherwise it returns the
number of characters that would have been printed had @@var{n} been
sufficiently large, regardless of the actual value of @@var{n}.  Note
some pre-C99 system libraries do not implement this correctly so users
cannot generally rely on the return value if the system version of
this function is used.
