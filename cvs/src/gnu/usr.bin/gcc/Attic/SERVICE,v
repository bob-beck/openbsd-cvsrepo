GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:
	gnu@@gnu.org

Altrasoft provides corporate-quality support, development and user
documentation for GNU Emacs, XEmacs and InfoDock.  (InfoDock is a turnkey
information management and software development toolset built atop emacs,
written by one of our associates.)  Emacs distributions for a variety of
platforms are also available, as is support for other emacs variants, such as
those often found on PCs.

Our unique focus on emacs-related work allows us to attract expert talent in
this area to keep you on the leading edge of productivity, especially if you
do software development work.  We do the porting, patching, coding,
integrating, debugging, documenting and testing so that your people spend
much more productive time on their mainline tasks.

Standard support packages include help on all aspects of the packages
supported, including all tools shipped as a standard part of the original
package distribution.  In general, we want to give you an unbelievably strong
level of support, so where we can, we will also answer questions concerning
any add-on Lisp code that is used at your site.  Setup and customization
help, bug fixes, and announcements of new releases are, of course, included.

Support rates start at $1,500 USD, for single user support for one year.
Discounts are available for group contracts.  We also offer Golden Support
contracts for those who need the absolute best in mission-critical support;
contact us for details.  Hourly development rates and fixed bid work are
available.

http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~kiniry/resume.html for more information on
professional and academic background.

I provide installation, porting, debugging, customization, design, and
development of GNU and other UNIX and non-UNIX software.  I am or have
been a certified developer with Microsoft, SunSoft, NeXT, and Amiga.
I have a great deal of development and management experience and an
extremely broad background which contributes to my excellent system
integration capabilities.  I have a special expertise and conduct
research in distributed object technologies.

Time and material rates for local work vary regionally, but are
currently $250 per hour on the west coast.  Other rates apply for
long-term jobs (day rates, travel, etc.) and remote work (usually 1/2
fee).  I am interested in fixed-bid jobs and will work for lower rates
for non-profit organizations and educational institutions.

Background: I have extensive experience with programming under Unix, in C
in particular (since 1983), with standards and specifications for Internet
protocols (since 1987), International Standards for character sets and
encoding schemes (since 1988), ISO 8879 SGML (since 1990, national head of
delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 18/WG 8 since 1991), and ANSI X3.226 Common
Lisp (since early 1994).  I have been an Emacs user and programmer from
1984 to 1987 (TOPS-20) and from 1991 to present (Unix).  since early 1994,
I have worked on GNU Emacs development, in both Lisp and C, and since mid
1995, I have been tracking the development code.

Services I offer the free software community include supporting Emacs users
and programmers with expert advice (gratis on USENET or mailing lists where
others may benefit), customizing and writing Emacs functions and packages,
delivering courses and seminars from tutorials to writing Emacs Lisp and C
extensions, and providing general aid with all GNU software.

My standard rate is a flat USD 80 per hour or USD 2 per minute (you decide
which time unit to apply), but to offset the cost of processing money, the
minimum credit card charge is USD 100 and the minimum invoiced amount is
USD 250.  Discounts are available to worthy causes -- present your case.
Time away from home is billed at USD 40 per hour around the clock to
encourage remote work.  (Courses and seminars are negotiated individually.)

Please call only about actual work, I prefer mail for all other questions.

Experience:
    I have B.A. and M.A. degrees in Computer Science and have completed
    all but the dissertation for a Ph.D. in C.S.  My research for my
    Ph.D.  is in the areas of logic, type systems, and programming
    language theory.  My primary programming languages are Emacs Lisp,
    Perl, and Bourne shell, but of course I can program in any language.
    I have written numerous Emacs Lisp packages.  I started the USENET
    "List of Frequently Asked Questions about GNU Emacs with Answers" and
    maintained it for more than two years.  Most of my work has been
    related to the telephone system (modems, voice mail, etc.), but I am
    not limited to that.  Send e-mail for my complete resume or curriculum

Programs supported:
    GNU Emacs and Taylor UUCP:
      Installation, training, customization, bug fixing, troubleshooting,

    Any other GNU program:
      The same things, but I don't necessarily have huge amounts of
      experience with the particular program.

Working conditions:
    I am usually available for part-time work (less than 20 hours per week
    including any travel time).  I can sometimes make time for full-time
    work for a month or two; please inquire.  I can either work in or near
    Boston or via the Internet or via telephone; travel outside the Boston
    metropolitan area can be negotiated.  My schedule is very flexible.
    Any programs I write will normally have the copying conditions of the
    GNU General Public License; this is negotiable.

Rates: $65/hour as an independent contractor.
       travel and telephone expenses.
       higher rates if extensive travel is required.

I'm a better "planner" than I am a hacker.  A really good hacker will be able
to keep many pieces of information in their short-term memory and to memorize
new pieces of information at a fast rate.  This is not my strong point.
Rather, I excel in domains that require knowledge of the slightly more
theoretical parts of computer science --for example, logic, formal methods of
program development, and functional programming.  I can write, and I have
"tutoring" (teaching one-on-one) experience, an, unlike some programmers,
I enjoy doing these things.

I have spend a lot of time looking at the Emacs Lisp sources and customizing
Emacs and VM.  I think I can customize Emacs and its packages quickly and
effectively.

Altrasoft provides corporate-quality support, development and user
documentation for GNU Emacs, XEmacs and InfoDock.  (InfoDock is a turnkey
information management and software development toolset built atop emacs,
written by one of our associates.)  Emacs distributions for a variety of
platforms are also available, as is support for other emacs variants, such as
those often found on PCs.

Our unique focus on emacs-related work allows us to attract expert talent in
this area to keep you on the leading edge of productivity, especially if you
do software development work.  We do the porting, patching, coding,
integrating, debugging, documenting and testing so that your people spend
much more productive time on their mainline tasks.

Standard support packages include help on all aspects of the packages
supported, including all tools shipped as a standard part of the original
package distribution.  In general, we want to give you an unbelievably strong
level of support, so where we can, we will also answer questions concerning
any add-on Lisp code that is used at your site.  Setup and customization
help, bug fixes, and announcements of new releases are, of course, included.

Support rates start at $1,500 USD, for single user support for one year.
Discounts are available for group contracts.  We also offer Golden Support
contracts for those who need the absolute best in mission-critical support;
contact us for details.  Hourly development rates and fixed bid work are
available.

Long-term high-level consultant in a variety of domains.  See
http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~kiniry/resume.html for more information on
professional and academic background.

I provide installation, porting, debugging, customization, design, and
development of GNU and other UNIX and non-UNIX software.  I am or have
been a certified developer with Microsoft, SunSoft, NeXT, and Amiga.
I have a great deal of development and management experience and an
extremely broad background which contributes to my excellent system
integration capabilities.  I have a special expertise and conduct
research in distributed object technologies.

Time and material rates for local work vary regionally, but are
currently $250 per hour on the west coast.  Other rates apply for
long-term jobs (day rates, travel, etc.) and remote work (usually 1/2
fee).  I am interested in fixed-bid jobs and will work for lower rates
for non-profit organizations and educational institutions.

I am available for Unix system administration consulting, including but not
limited to installation, configuration and integration of GNU tools and other
copy-lefted software such as GNU/Linux and the various distributions of
GNU/Linux.

I am particularly skilled at integration of GNU and other copy-lefted software
into new environments that have not used such tools in the past, and porting
the GNU software to new Unix-based platforms.

Please visit my homepage for more information on my background and skills.  My
resume is also available there.

I am available for both 1099 (preferred) and W2 on-site contracting in the
Cincinnati, OH, USA metropolitan area, as well as remote consulting via dialup
or Internet connection anywhere in the USA.  I have no interest in permanent
relocation at this time.
 
My rate varies greatly between $25-$40/hour, depending on the circumstances.
Rates for non-profit organizations are substantially lower, and possibly free.

Please note that I have no interest in working with any Micro$oft related
products!  I want the primary focus of my work to be contributing
to the free software community.

I will help install badly-behaved source code packages, and have experience
fixing them to conform to GNU standards.  I will gladly help novices and
intermediate computer users to understand, install, and use free software,
whether or not I have prior experience with that software.  I know my
limitations well, and will freely give other contacts if I do not want to
solve your problem myself.

I have installed and administered free and proprietary systems in home,
academic, and business environments.  I have practical experience in most
aspects of Unix and network security.  I know how to diagnose a complex
existing computer system and incrementally replace it with a superior free
system without disrupting service.

I have over 2 years of experience with several of the major free OSes:
Linux/GNU (Red Hat, Debian, Slackware), NetBSD, FreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd.  I am
the maintainer of GNU Libtool and GNU DLD.  Some of my specialties are:
Emacs, Automake, Autoconf, SANE, C, Perl, and shell script programming.

My rates start at $10 (Canadian dollars) per hour.  When I am not starving, I
do not charge worthy non-profit organizations.

Background: I have extensive experience with programming under Unix, in C
in particular (since 1983), with standards and specifications for Internet
protocols (since 1987), International Standards for character sets and
encoding schemes (since 1988), ISO 8879 SGML (since 1990, national head of
delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 18/WG 8 since 1991), and ANSI X3.226 Common
Lisp (since early 1994).  I have been an Emacs user and programmer from
1984 to 1987 (TOPS-20) and from 1991 to present (Unix).  since early 1994,
I have worked on GNU Emacs development, in both Lisp and C, and since mid
1995, I have been tracking the development code.

Services I offer the free software community include supporting Emacs users
and programmers with expert advice (gratis on USENET or mailing lists where
others may benefit), customizing and writing Emacs functions and packages,
delivering courses and seminars from tutorials to writing Emacs Lisp and C
extensions, and providing general aid with all GNU software.

My standard rate is a flat USD 80 per hour or USD 2 per minute (you decide
which time unit to apply), but to offset the cost of processing money, the
minimum credit card charge is USD 100 and the minimum invoiced amount is
USD 250.  Discounts are available to worthy causes -- present your case.
Time away from home is billed at USD 40 per hour around the clock to
encourage remote work.  (Courses and seminars are negotiated individually.)

Please call only about actual work, I prefer mail for all other questions.
