/* The variable cc_status says how to interpret the condition code.
   It is set by output routines for an instruction that sets the cc's
   and examined by output routines for jump instructions.

   cc_status contains two components named `value1' and `value2'
   that record two equivalent expressions for the values that the
   condition codes were set from.  (Either or both may be null if
   there is no useful expression to record.)  These fields are
   used for eliminating redundant test and compare instructions
   in the cases where the condition codes were already set by the
   previous instruction.

   cc_status.flags contains flags which say that the condition codes
   were set in a nonstandard manner.  The output of jump instructions
   uses these flags to compensate and produce the standard result
   with the nonstandard condition codes.  Standard flags are defined here.
   The tm.h file can also define other machine-dependent flags.

   cc_status also contains a machine-dependent component `mdep'
   whose type, `CC_STATUS_MDEP', may be defined as a macro in the
   tm.h file.  */
