/* A register conflict graph is an undirected graph containing nodes
   for some or all of the regs used in a function.  Arcs represent
   conflicts, i.e. two nodes are connected by an arc if there is a
   point in the function at which the regs corresponding to the two
   nodes are both live.

   The conflict graph is represented by the data structures described
   in Morgan section 11.3.1.  Nodes are not stored explicitly; only
   arcs are.  An arc stores the numbers of the regs it connects.

   Arcs can be located by two methods:

     - The two reg numbers for each arc are hashed into a single
       value, and the arc is placed in a hash table according to this
       value.  This permits quick determination of whether a specific
       conflict is present in the graph.  

     - Additionally, the arc data structures are threaded by a set of
       linked lists by single reg number.  Since each arc references
       two regs, there are two next pointers, one for the
       smaller-numbered reg and one for the larger-numbered reg.  This
       permits the quick enumeration of conflicts for a single
       register.

   Arcs are allocated from an obstack.  */

   Preconditions: the flow graph must be in SSA form, and life
   analysis (specifically, regs live at exit from each block) must be
   up-to-date.  

   This algorithm determines conflicts by walking the insns in each
   block backwards.  We maintain the set of live regs at each insn,
   starting with the regs live on exit from the block.  For each insn:
 
     1. If a reg is set in this insns, it must be born here, since
        we're in SSA.  Therefore, it was not live before this insns,
	so remove it from the set of live regs.  

     2. For each reg born in this insn, record a conflict between it
	and every other reg live coming into this insn.  For each
	existing conflict, one of the two regs must be born while the
	other is alive.  See Morgan or elsewhere for a proof of this.

     3. Regs clobbered by this insn must have been live coming into
        it, so record them as such.  

   The resulting conflict graph is not built for regs in REGS
   themselves; rather, partition P is used to obtain the canonical reg
   for each of these.  The nodes of the conflict graph are these
   canonical regs instead.  */
