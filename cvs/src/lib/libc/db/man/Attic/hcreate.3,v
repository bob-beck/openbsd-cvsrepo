.Dt HCREATE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hcreate ,
.Nm hdestroy ,
.Nm hsearch
.Nd manage hash search table
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <search.h>
.Ft int
.Fn hcreate "size_t nel"
.Ft void
.Fn hdestroy "void"
.Ft ENTRY *
.Fn hsearch "ENTRY item" "ACTION action"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn hcreate ,
.Fn hdestroy
and
.Fn hsearch
functions manage hash search tables.
.Pp
The
.Fn hcreate
function allocates and initializes the table.
The
.Fa nel
argument specifies an estimate of the maximum number of entries to be held
by the table.
Unless further memory allocation fails, supplying an
insufficient
.Fa nel
value will not result in functional harm, although a performance degradation
may occur.
Initialization using the
.Fn hcreate
function is mandatory prior to any access operations using
.Fn hsearch .
.Pp
The
.Fn hdestroy
function destroys a table previously created using
.Fn hcreate .
After a call to
.Fn hdestroy ,
the data can no longer be accessed.
.Pp
The
.Fn hsearch
function is used to search to the hash table.
It returns a pointer into the hash table indicating the address of an item.
The
.Fa item
argument is of type
.Dv ENTRY ,
a structural type which contains the following members:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width voidX*dataXX
.It Fa char *key
comparison key.
.It Fa void *data
pointer to data associated with
.Fa key .
.El
.Pp
The key comparison function used by
.Fn hsearch
is
.Xr strcmp 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fa action
argument is of type
.Dv ACTION ,
an enumeration type which defines the following values:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width ENTERXX
.It Dv ENTER
Insert
.Fa item
into the hash table.
If an existing item with the same key is found, it is not replaced.
Note that the
.Fa key
and
.Fa data
elements of
.Fa item
are used directly by the new table entry.
The storage for the
key must not be modified during the lifetime of the hash table.
.It Dv FIND
Search the hash table without inserting
.Fa item .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn hcreate
function returns a non-zero value.
Otherwise, a value of 0 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn hdestroy
functions
returns no value.
.Pp
If successful, the
.Fn hsearch
function returns a pointer to hash table entry matching
the provided key.
If the action is
.Dv FIND
and the item was not found, or if the action is
.Dv ENTER
and the insertion failed,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
If the action is
.Dv ENTER
and an entry already existed in the table matching the given
key, the existing entry is returned and is not replaced.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn hcreate
and
.Fn hsearch
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory is available.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bsearch 3 ,
.Xr lsearch 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr strcmp 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn hcreate ,
.Fn hdestroy
and
.Fn hsearch
functions conform to
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn hcreate ,
.Fn hdestroy
and
.Fn hsearch
functions first appeared in
.At V .
.Sh BUGS
The interface permits the use of only one hash table at a time.
