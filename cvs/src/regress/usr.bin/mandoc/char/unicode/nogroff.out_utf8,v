log
@Apparently, some recent update of Unicode data in the base system
changed the output of wcwidth(3) for some weird Unicode characters,
causing harmless whitespace changes in mandoc(1) output; fix up the
regression suite accordingly.
The processing of the characters themselves still works correctly,
as it did before, and that's what these tests are intended to make
sure.  They were never intended to check for whitespace issues.
Problem reported by jsg@@.
