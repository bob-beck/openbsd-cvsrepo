  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt

/*
     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

     This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.

     The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.

   The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has
   dropped to zero. It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out
   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
   opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

*/


ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some
  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows. deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.

  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of deflate(). If deflate returns Z_OK
  and with zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the
  output buffer because there might be more output pending.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far. (In particular
  avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided
  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression
  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there
  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be
  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After
  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the
  stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least
  the value returned by deflateBound (see below). If deflate does not return
  Z_STREAM_END, then it must be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT). In doubt, the data is considered
  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
  the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible
  (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero). Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not
  fatal, and deflate() can be called again with more input and more output
  space to continue compressing.
*/


ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateEnd OF((z_streamp strm));
/*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
   pending output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded). In the error case,
   msg may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*/


/*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller. If next_in is not Z_NULL and avail_in is large enough (the exact
   value depends on the compression method), inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  msg is set to null if there is no error
   message. inflateInit does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the zlib header if present: this will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and
   avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)
*/


ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows. inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the flush parameter).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate(). If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH,
  Z_FINISH, or Z_BLOCK. Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. Z_BLOCK requests that inflate() stop
  if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding the
  zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately after
  the header and before the first block. When doing a raw inflate, inflate()
  will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it gets to
  the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  Also to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64
  if inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream,
  plus 128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block
  code or decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the
  deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the
  uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The
  number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when
  bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be
  less than eight.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster approach
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call. So the only effect of the flush parameter in this implementation
  is on the return value of inflate(), as noted below, or when it returns early
  because Z_BLOCK is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below. At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() will decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically.  Any information
  contained in the gzip header is not retained, so applications that need that
  information should instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or
  inflateBack() and perform their own processing of the gzip header and
  trailer.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,
  Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the
  output buffer when Z_FINISH is used. Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing. If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may then
  call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial recovery
  of the data is desired.

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method. It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library. Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage. The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate. In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size. deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute an adler32 check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding. Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper. The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero),
   no header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown).  If a
   gzip stream is being written, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. Z_RLE is designed to be almost as fast as
   Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy
   parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the
   compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.  Z_FIXED prevents the
   use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special
   applications.

      deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method). msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

/*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output. This function must be called
   immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, before any
   call of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in
   deflate or deflate2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In addition, the
   current implementation of deflate will use at most the window size minus
   262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   adler32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if the compression method is bsort). deflateSetDictionary does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is
   a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a null strm). msg
   is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform
   any decompression apart from reading the zlib header if present: this will

   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned
   an error.  If strm->next is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to
   out() returning non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so
   strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note
   that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.

  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

     The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

     This library does not provide any functions to write gzip files in memory.
  However such functions could be easily written using zlib's deflate function,

d344 5
a348 20
    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH,
  Z_FINISH, or Z_BLOCK. Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. Z_BLOCK requests that inflate() stop
  if and when it get to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding the zlib
  or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately after the
  header and before the first block. When doing a raw inflate, inflate() will
  go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it gets to the end
  of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  Also to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64
  if inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream,
  plus 128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block
  code or decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the
  deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the
  uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The
  number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when
  bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be
  less than eight.

  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster approach
d361 8
a368 21
     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call. So the only effect of the flush parameter in this implementation
  is on the return value of inflate(), as noted below, or when it returns early
  because Z_BLOCK is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm-adler to the adler32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below. At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() will decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically.  Any information
  contained in the gzip header is not retained, so applications that need that
  information should instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or
  inflateBack() and perform their own processing of the gzip header and
  trailer.

  Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the

  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing. If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may then
  call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial recovery
  of the data is desired.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits

   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments

     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than inflate() for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free
   the allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned
   an error.  If strm->next is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to
   out() returning non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so
   strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note
   that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.

a247 18
    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, the current compression
  block is terminated and flushed to the output buffer so that the
  decompressor can get all input data available so far. For method 9, a future
  variant on method 8, the current block will be flushed but not terminated.
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH has the same effect as partial flush except that the compressed
  output is byte aligned (the compressor can clear its internal bit buffer)
  and the current block is always terminated; this can be useful if the
  compressor has to be restarted from scratch after an interruption (in which
  case the internal state of the compressor may be lost).
    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, the compression block is terminated, a
  special marker is output and the compression dictionary is discarded; this
  is useful to allow the decompressor to synchronize if one compressed block
  has been damaged (see inflateSync below).  Flushing degrades compression and
  so should be used only when necessary.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can
  seriously degrade the compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0,
  this function must be called again with the same value of the flush
  parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is
  complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out).

     If next_out is not null, the library will use this buffer for the history

   history information inside this buffer from call to call; the application
   can only reset next_out to the beginning of the history buffer when
   avail_out is zero and all output has been consumed.
