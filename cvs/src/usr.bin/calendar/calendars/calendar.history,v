@correct(ish) date of death for alexander the great;
from soren jacobsen, netbsd -r1.26

i've done it a bit differently though: since the date was listed
both in .birthday and .history i added his (reputed) birth date
to .birthday and removed the dup. i also standardised the date
as "[year][space]BC".

@david livingstone, not livingston;

i picked this up from greg lehey's commit in freebsd, -r242849: that commit
also changes the date of stanley's encounter from 10th nov. to 27th of oct.
since the internet doesn;t seem to agree and not having anything
authorative to hand, i have left the date untouched (i.e. 10th nov.).

@From NetBSD: clear up the Pioneer 10 entry.  While I'm at it, I've moved
fictional events (mainly from Lord of the Rings) to calendar.fictional,
removed a few events which don't really correspond to a specific date,
and fixed a few duplicates and such.  This file has still not been
fact-checked, though.
