@In private header files, __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS are pointless.
Because these work slightly differently on different systems,
they are becoming a maintenance burden in the portable version,
so delete them.

Besides, one of the chief design goals of the mandoc toolbox is to
make sure that nothing related to documentation requires C++.
Consequently, linking mandoc against any kind of C++ program would
defeat the purpose and is not supported.
I don't understand why kristaps@@ added them in the first place.

@Remove the hack of scrolling forward and backward with +G1G that
many (jmc@@, millert@@, espie@@, deraadt@@) considered revolting.
Instead, when using a pager, since we are using a temporary file
for tags anyway, use another temporary file for the formatted
page(s), as suggested by millert@@ and similar to what the traditional
BSD man(1) did, except that we use only one single temporary output
file rather than one for each formatted manual page, such that
searching (both with / and :t) works across all the displayed files.

While here, shorten the code by two lines

@Initial, still somewhat experimental implementation to leverage
less(1) -T and :t ctags(1)-like functionality to jump to the
definitions of various terms inside manual pages.
To be polished in the tree, so bear with me and report issues.

Technically, if less(1) is used as a pager, information is collected
by the mdoc(7) terminal formatter, first stored using the ohash
library, then ultimately written to a temporary file which is passed
to less via -T.  No change intended for other output formatters or
when running without a pager.

Based on an idea from Kristaps using feedback from many, in particular
