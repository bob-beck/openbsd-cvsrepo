schools. UNAM is Mexico's largest University, with over 250,000 students,
and at ENEP Iztacala we have a bit over 10,000 students. This is mostly
a health-oriented campus, so the computer area is not a big one.
<br>
We run as servers currently two OpenBSD, one Solaris and two Linux boxes.
With OpenBSD we handle the main web site (happily running on a 7-year old
Sparcstation 5), part of our mail accounts and our firewall.
<br>
There are two additional OpenBSD computers, in our development area. One of
them acts as a network monitor (using Snort) and will shortly be moved to
sit next to the firewall, and the other one serves as an OpenBSD CVS
mirror.
<br>
We do not do run very creative stuff, we just use OpenBSD for what it does
best: run smoothly, even on older hardware, freeing us from most concerns
and doubts we have about our other operating systems.
<br>
We also host a Spanish OpenBSD mailing list (openbsd@@tlali.iztacala.unam.mx).
