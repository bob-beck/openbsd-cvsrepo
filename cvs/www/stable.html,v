<h3 id="whatis">What is the <i>-stable</i> branch?</h3>

The <i>-stable</i> branch is one of OpenBSD's three
<a href="faq/faq5.html#Flavors">flavors</a>.
It consists of the release and <a href="errata.html">errata</a> patches.
More precisely:

<ul>
  <li>Errata entries are made for bugs which affect many people.
  <li>Other patches may be merged into <i>-stable</i> if they affect a few
      people in drastic ways.
  <li>New or changed functionality, hardware support or APIs will <i>not</i> be
      merged.
</ul>

<h3 id="getting">Getting <i>-stable</i> source code</h3>

To obtain the <i>-stable</i> tree for a particular release of OpenBSD, you can
<a href="anoncvs.html#updating">update</a> on top of a pre-existing source tree
or you can <a href="anoncvs.html#getting">check out</a> a fresh source tree from
an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server.

<p>
<!-- XXXrelease - bump href to upgradeXX.html -->
Do not attempt to go from one release to another via source.
Instead, please follow the <a href="faq/upgrade60.html">upgrade guide</a> for
the release before compiling <i>-stable</i>.

<h3 id="building">Building OpenBSD <i>-stable</i></h3>
<!-- XXXrelease - figure out a way to deal with build:wobj -->

Details on building OpenBSD from source are provided in steps 2 and 3 of the
<!-- XXXrelease - remove "OpenBSD-6.0/" from man link -->
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.0/release">release(8)</a> manual.
There is also an FAQ on <a href="faq/faq5.html">building the system</a>.
If you have a number of machines to keep on the <i>-stable</i> branch, you may
wish to <a href="faq/faq5.html#Release">make a release</a>.

<h4>Rebuild the kernel and reboot</h4>

Replace <tt>GENERIC</tt> with <tt>GENERIC.MP</tt> for multiprocessor systems.

<!-- XXX release: interpolate 'make obj' -->
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /sys/arch/$(machine)/conf</b>
# <b>config GENERIC</b>
# <b>cd /sys/arch/$(machine)/compile/GENERIC</b>
# <b>make clean && make && make install</b>
# <b>reboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If your system has trouble booting the new kernel, you can easily go back
and reboot from the old kernel, now called <tt>obsd</tt>.

<h4>Rebuilding the userland</h4>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -rf /usr/obj/*</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>make obj && make build</b>

<a name="whatis"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">What is the <i>-stable</i> (patch)
branch?</font></h3>

OpenBSD provides a source tree that contains important patches and fixes
(i.e. those from the <a href="errata.html">errata</a>, plus others which
are obvious and simple, but do not deserve an errata entry)
and makes it available via <a href="anoncvs.html">CVS</a>, in addition to the
<i>-current</i> source.
Thus, users can choose three options:
a31 1
<p>
d33 5
a37 3
<li>Stick with our latest release and apply the patches by hand.
<li>Use the <i>-stable</i> ("patch") branch, which has those patches.
<li>Use the <i>-current</i> branch for all of the latest features.
d40 1
a40 5
<p>
As a general principle, all <a href="errata.html">errata</a> entries will
be merged into the patch branch shortly before/after they are published.
Other post-release patches may be merged in as well, subject to a number
of conditions:
d42 4
a45 13
<ul>
<li>The patches must be simple, short, and obviously 100% correct.
<li>Errata entries are made for bugs which affect many people.
    Other patches may be merged into the patch branch if they affect a few
    people in drastic ways.
<li>New or changed functionality, hardware support or APIs will <i>not</i>
    be merged.
    In general, if it requires a man page change, it will NOT be a candidate
    for the patch branch.
    Please do not ask for large subsystems or patches to be merged.
    Maintaining the patch tree takes a lot of effort which could be better
    spent on making our next release better. 
</ul>
d48 4
a51 22
It is worth pointing out the name <i>-stable</i> refers ONLY to the API
and operations of OpenBSD not changing, not the overall reliability of
the system.
In fact, if things go as desired, the <i>-current</i> 
<a href="faq/faq5.html#Flavors">flavor</a> of OpenBSD, on its way to
becoming the next <i>-release</i>, will be an improvement in reliability,
security and overall quality over the previous <i>-release</i> and
<i>-stable</i>.

<a name="getting"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">Getting <i>-stable</i> source code</font></h3>

To obtain the patch branch for a particular release of OpenBSD, you can
update on top of a pre-existing source tree (from <a href="ftp.html">
a mirror</a> or the <a href="orders.html">CD</a>), or you can grab a
fresh source tree from an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server.
Instructions for getting the patch branch and staying up to date are
described in the <b>Getting Started</b> section of the
<a href="anoncvs.html#starting">AnonCVS documentation</a>.
Note that patch branches do not help to upgrade from one release of
OpenBSD to another. They only provide a means for staying up to date
with the patches within a given release.
d53 6
a58 12
<p>
Do not attempt to go from one release to another via source.
Instead, please read the upgrade guide for the release in question.
Also, you cannot go backwards, from -current back to -stable, because of
library versioning problems and other changes.

<a name="building"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">Building OpenBSD <i>-stable</i></font></h3>

Full details on building from source are provided
<a href="faq/faq5.html">here</a>.
This is a simplified summary.
d61 6
a66 3
Once you have obtained a source tree via <a href="anoncvs.html">CVS</a>,
you must rebuild the system.
The steps for doing so are:
d68 1
a68 5
<ul>
 <li>Rebuild the kernel
 <li>Reboot with the new kernel
 <li>Rebuild the userland
</ul>
d70 1
a70 3
<h4><font color="#0000e0">Rebuilding the kernel</font></h4>

To rebuild the default kernel from stable:
a76 10
</pre></blockquote>

Replace <tt>GENERIC</tt> with <tt>GENERIC.MP</tt> for multiprocessor systems.

<h4><font color="#0000e0">Rebooting with the new kernel</font></h4>

To reboot with the newly compiled kernel:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/$(uname -m)/compile/GENERIC</b>
d84 1
a84 1
<h4><font color="#0000e0">Rebuilding the userland</font></h4>
a95 12

This may take some time, depending on the speed of your system.
Use of the root account can be limited to only the final step if you
follow the instructions on <a href="faq/faq5.html#BldGetSrc">this page</a>.

<p>
If you have a number of machines to keep on the <i>-stable</i> branch,
you may wish to make a <a href="faq/faq5.html#Release">release</a> by
creating <a href="faq/faq4.html#FilesNeeded">file sets</a> that can be
quickly and easily installed on any machine of the same platform.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=release">
release(8)</a> man page contains all the relevant information.

becoming the next <i>-release</i>, will be an improvement in
reliability, security and overall quality over the previous
<i>-release</i> and <i>-stable</i>.
d75 4
a78 6
<p>
To obtain the patch branch for a particular release of OpenBSD, you
can update on top of a pre-existing source tree
(from <a href="ftp.html">a mirror</a> or the <a href="orders.html">CD</a>)
or you can grab the source tree freshly from
an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server.
d94 1
d100 3
a102 2
Once you have obtained a source tree via <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>,
you must rebuild the system.  The stages for doing so are:
d107 1
a107 1
 <li>Rebuild the binaries
a111 1
<p>
d113 1
d115 4
a118 4
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf</strong>
# <strong>/usr/sbin/config GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>make clean &amp;&amp; make</strong>
d121 1
a121 4
<p>
Replace <i>i386</i> with your architecture, e.g.
<i>sparc</i>, <i>alpha</i>, etc. Replace <i>GENERIC</i> with
<i>GENERIC.MP</i> for multiprocessor systems.
a124 1
<p>
d126 1
d128 3
a130 3
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>make install</strong>          <i>(Safely install new kernel)</i>
# <strong>reboot</strong>
d133 4
a136 4
<p>
As above, substitute your architecture for <i>i386</i>.  If your system has
trouble booting the new kernel, you can easily go back and reboot from the
old kernel, now called <i>obsd</i>.
d138 1
a138 1
<h4><font color="#0000e0">Rebuilding the binaries</font></h4>
a139 1
<p> To rebuild the system binaries:
d141 6
a146 6
# <strong>rm -rf /usr/obj/*</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>make obj</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/etc &amp;&amp; env DESTDIR=/ make distrib-dirs</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>make build</strong>
d149 3
a151 3
<p>This will take some time.
Depending on the speed of the system, it may take less than an hour to
a week or more.
d154 6
a159 5
If you have a number of machines to keep at <i>-stable</i>, you may wish to 
make a <a href="faq/faq5.html#Release">release</a>, creating the
standard install <a href="faq/faq4.html#FilesNeeded">file sets</a>,
which can then be quickly and easily installed on any machine of the
same <a href="plat.html">platform</a>.

important points, point to full build instructions in faq5.html, bump
copyright, don't even try to upgrade by source, "make install" to
install the kernel (which had been suggested at least once by someone,
and I didn't implement then because much more needed to be done to this
page).  Inspired by and ok aanriot@@

Starting with 2.7, OpenBSD provides a source tree that contains
important patches and fixes (i.e. those from the
<a href="errata.html">errata</a> plus others which are obvious and simple,
but do not deserve an errata entry)
and makes it available via <a href="anoncvs.html">CVS</a> in addition to the
current source.  Thus, users can choose three options :<p>
d40 3
a42 3
<li>Stick with our latest release and apply the patches by hand.
<li>Use the <b>patch branch</b> which has the most important patches applied.
<li>Use <b>current source</b> for all of the latest features.
d45 6
a50 6
<!-- The <a href="plus.html">Daily Changelog</a> details (amoung other things)

As a general principle, all
<a href="errata.html">Errata</a> entries will be merged into the patch
branch within 48 hours of when an errata is published.  Other post release
patches may be merged in as well, subject to a number of conditions:
d52 9

<li>The patches must be simple, short, and obviously 100% correct.
<li>Errata entries are made for bugs which affect many people.  Other
    patches may be merged into the patch branch if they affect a few
    people in drastic ways.
<li>Please do not ask for large subsystems or patches to be merged.
    Maintaining the patch tree takes a lot of effort which could be
    better spent on making our next release better. 
<li>As an exception to the above rules, OpenSSH release versions will be
    merged into the patch branch.

<h3><font color=#0000e0>Getting a stable branch</font></h3>
d68 15
a82 15
To obtain the patch branch for a particular release of OpenBSD, you
can update on top of a pre-existing source tree
(from <a href="ftp.html">FTP</a> or the <a href="orders.html">CD</a>)
or you can grab the source tree freshly from
an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server.
Instructions for getting the patch branch and staying up to date are
described in the <b>Getting Started</b> section of the
<a href="anoncvs.html#starting">AnonCVS documentation</a>.
Note that patch branches do not help to upgrade from one release of
OpenBSD to another, e.g. to go from 3.8 to 3.9.  They only provide
a means for staying up to date with the patches within a given release.
If you are trying to go from one release to another via source, please visit
the <a href="faq/upgrade38.html">upgrade guide</a>.
Also, you cannot go backwards, from -current back to -stable, because of
library versioning problems.

<h3><font color=#0000e0>Building from an OpenBSD patch branch</font></h3>
Once you have obtained a source tree via <a href="anoncvs.html">anoncvs</a>,
you must rebuild the system.  The stages for doing so are:
d90 3
a92 3
 <li>Rebuild the kernel
 <li>Reboot with the new kernel
 <li>Rebuild the binaries
d95 1

<h4><font color=#0000e0>Rebuilding the kernel</font></h4>
d98 1
a98 1
To rebuild the default kernel from stable:
d107 2
a108 2
Replace <i>i386</i> with your architecture, e.g.
<i>sparc</i>, <i>alpha</i>, etc.
d110 1
a110 1
<h4><font color=#0000e0>Rebooting with the new kernel</font></h4>
d113 1
a113 1
To reboot with the newly compiled kernel:
d116 2
a117 2
# <strong>cp /bsd /bsd.old</strong>          <i>(Save an old copy of your kernel)</i>
# <strong>cp bsd /bsd</strong>               <i>(Copy the new kernel into place)</i>
d122 3
a124 3
As above, substitute your architecture for <i>i386</i>.  If your system has
trouble booting the new kernel, you can easily go back and reboot from the
old kernel, now called <i>bsd.old</i>.

Starting with 2.7, the OpenBSD project is providing a source
tree that contains the patches and fixes from the
<a href="errata.html">errata</a> and making
it available via <a href="anoncvs.html">CVS</a> in addition to the
current source.  Users can choose to follow either branch: current
for those who want/need all of the latest features, and the patch
branch for those who want to stick with releases and only require
the fixes and patches between releases.

a72 6
To obtain a patch branch for a particular release of OpenBSD, you
can either start with a source tree from the CD shipped with the release
of OpenBSD you want to use (see <a href="orders.html">ordering</a>), or
you can grab the whole tree from an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server.
The instructions for getting a patch branch and staying up to date are
described in the Getting Started section of the
d74 4

<p>
Please note that the patch branches are not helpful for upgrading from one
release of OpenBSD to another, eg. to go from 2.5 to 2.6.  They only provide
a means for staying up to date with the patches for a given release.  If
you are trying to go from one release to another via source, please visit
