The term "users" has several connotations. <em>End users</em> often
want to meet other users of the system, to share ideas, problems and solutions,
and discuss the system over a meal or a beer. One of the best ways to do this
is with one of our 
<a href="groups.html">User Groups worldwide</a>.
<p>
Another connotation of the term is "who is using the system, and for what?",
and that is the subject of the rest of this page.  These <a 
href="#com">companies</a> and organizations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. 
<a href="#edu">University researchers</a> and IT department developers often 
have similar security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.
Many <a href="#isp">Internet Service Providers</a> find OpenBSD's

<li><a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">The Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI)</a><br>
This laboratory at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. <p>

delighted with OpenBSD's performance, reliability, and pro-active
attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high

and other synchronous communications hardware and software for the OpenBSD
platform. This hardware is in use in many ISPs world-wide and shows how
effectively OpenBSD can be used as a communications routing platform for
IP routing. These products allow OpenBSD-based machines to directly
connect at 56kbs DDS, T1 lines or frame relay networks, eliminating the
need for an external router. <br>
On the software end, ET/BWMGR, ET's Bandwith Manager, a part of their
software drivers, has been ported to the OpenBSD platform. The bandwidth
manager can effectively be used as a solution for network managers who
need to tune bandwidth usage, control the bandwidth of their client sites,
and clear up network bottlenecks.
