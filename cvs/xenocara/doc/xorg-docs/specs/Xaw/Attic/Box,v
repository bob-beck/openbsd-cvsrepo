@Update to xorg-docs 1.6.

As with previous version, only manual pages in section 7 are
installed for now.
More work is needed to be able to format and install the docs
that have been converted to docbook xml.

The Box widget provides geometry management of arbitrary widgets in a
box of a specified dimension.  The children are rearranged when
resizing events occur either on the Box or its children, or when
children are managed or unmanaged.  The Box widget always attempts to
pack its children as tightly as possible within the geometry allowed by
its parent.  
.LP
Box widgets are commonly used to manage a related set of buttons and
are often called ButtonBox widgets, but the children are not
limited to buttons.  The Box's children are arranged on a background that
has its own specified dimensions and color.

When the Box is a child of a parent which enforces width constraints, it
is usually better to specify \fBXtorientVertical\fP (the default).
When the parent enforces height constraints, it is usually better to
specify \fBXtorientHorizontal\fP.

Layout Semantics
.IN "Box widget" "layout semantics"
.LP
Each time a child is managed or unmanaged, the Box widget will attempt
to reposition the remaining children to compact the box.  Children are
positioned in order left to right, top to bottom.  The packing
algorithm used depends on the \fBorientation\fP of the Box.
.IP \fBXtorientVertical\fP 1.5i
.IN "XtorientVertical" "" @@DEF@@
When the next child does not fit on the current row, a new row is
started.  If a child is wider than the width of the box, the box will
request a larger width from its parent and will begin the layout
process from the beginning if a new width is granted.
.IP \fBXtorientHorizontal\fP 1.5i
.IN "XtorientHorizontal" "" @@DEF@@
When the next child does not fit on the current row, the Box widens if
possible (so as to keep children on a single row); otherwise a new row is
started.
.LP
After positioning all children, the Box widget attempts to shrink its
own size to the minimum dimensions required for the layout.
