/*
 * PclPolyLine()
 * PclPolySegment()
 *
 * Generates PCL code to draw a polyline, or a collection of distinct
 * line segments, clipped by the current clip region.  Since PCL
 * supports clipping to a rectangle, and the clip region is
 * represented as a collection of visible rectangles, we can draw and
 * clip the line by repeatedly drawing the complete line, clipped to
 * each rectangle in the clip region.
 *
 * Since each box in the clipping region generates approximately 30
 * bytes of PCL code, we have to have a way to avoid having a large
 * number of boxes.  The worst problem the case where the clipping
 * region is a collection of one-pixel-high boxes, perhaps arising
 * from a bitmap clip mask, or a region defined by a non-rectangular
 * polygon.
 *
 * To alleviate this problem, we create a second clipping region,
 * which consists of the union of the bounding boxes of each line
 * segment.  (Each bounding box is also increased by some amount
 * related to the current line width to allow for non-zero-width
 * lines, and for the various end and join styles.)  This region is
 * intersected with the "real" clipping region to get the region used
 * to actually clip the polyline.  This should result in a significant
 * reduction in the number of clip rectangles, as the region-handling
 * code should consolidate many of the fragments of one-pixel-high
 * rectangles into larger rectangles.
